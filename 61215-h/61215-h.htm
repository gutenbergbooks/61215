</div>

<p class='c007'>Just as the forms are closing for the March edition of TROTWOOD’S
MONTHLY comes news of the death of Major John Wilson Thomas, who was
born in Nashville, Tennessee, on August 24, 1830, and died in Nashville, February
12, 1906.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the age of 28 he entered railroad work, and was in harness continually
up to the time of his death, being at that time President of the
Nashville, Chattanooga &amp; St. Louis Railroad.</p>

<p class='c008'>We regret that limited time and space will not permit us to give a detailed
account of the many incidents that made up the life of this great
and good man, but we are safe in saying that a more popular man never
lived in the South—or elsewhere. The “Old Man,” as he was affectionately
called by his employes, was ever ready to listen with a sympathetic ear to the
story of the unfortunate, and encouragement was always freely given. Every
employe under him was supposed to do his very best. He demanded everything
there was in a man, and got it; not from fear, but through the love
they had for him. His word was law and his decision final, for right and
justice always prevailed. No man was ever loved and respected more by
his employes than Major Thomas, and his record as a railroad man was
seldom if ever equaled. He did not grow up with the road, but it grew up
with him, and he made it what it is to-day.</p>

<p class='c008'>Somebody will take his place as president of the N., C. &amp; St. L. road, but
there is no one to take his place in the hearts of his friends. He was a
great and good man.</p>

<p class='c008'>[Through the kindness of John C. Winston
&amp; Co., publishers, of Philadelphia,
Pa., we are permitted to give to our
readers this treat, being one of the chapters
from the forthcoming novel of John
Trotwood Moore, entitled “The Bishop of
Cottontown,” now in the Winston press,
and which will be issued by them early
in March. This novel has been pronounced
truly great by many publishers’ readers.
It deals with child labor in the Southern
cotton mills and the Bishop is the kindly
old preacher and ex-trainer of ante-bellum
thoroughbreds, who is the hero of the
book.—E. E. Sweetland, Business Manager.]</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>It was ten o’clock and the Bishop
was on his way to church. He was
driving the old roan of the night before.
A parody on a horse, to one who did
not look closely, but to one who knows
and looks beyond the mere external form
for that hidden something in both man
and horse which bespeaks strength and
reserve force, there was seen through
the blindness and the ugliness and the
sleepy, ambling, shuffling gait a clean-cut
form, with deep chest and closely
ribbed; with well drawn flanks, a fine,
flat steel-turned bone, and a powerful
muscle, above hock and forearms, that
clung to the leg as the Bishop said, “like
bees aswarmin’.”</p>

<p class='c008'>At his little cottage gate stood Bud
Billings, the best slubber in the cotton
mill. Bud never talked to any one except
the Bishop, and his wife, who was
the worst Xantippe in Cottontown, declared
she had lived with him six
months straight and never heard him
come nearer speaking than a grunt. It
was also a saying of Richard Travis that
Bud had been known to break all records
for silence by drawing a year’s
wages at the mill, never missing a minute
and never speaking a word.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nor had he ever looked any one full
in the eye in his life.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the Bishop drove shamblingly
along down the road, deeply preoccupied
in his forthcoming sermon, there
came from out of a hole, situated somewhere
between the grizzled fringe of
hair that marked Bud’s whiskers and the
grizzled fringe above that marked his
eye-brows, a piping, apologetic voice that
sounded like the first few rasps of an
old rusty saw; but to the occupant of
the buggy it meant, with a drawl:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Howdy do, Bishop?”</p>

<p class='c008'>A blind horse is quick to observe and
take fright at anything uncanny. He is
the natural ghost-finder of the highways,
and that voice was too much for the old
roan. To him it sounded like something
that had been resurrected. It was a
ghost-voice, arising after many years.
He shied, sprang forward, half wheeled
and nearly upset the buggy, until
brought up with a jerk by the powerful
arms of his driver. The shaft-band had
broken and the buggy had run upon the
horse’s rump, and the shafts stuck up
almost at right angles over his back.
The roan stood trembling with the half
turned, inquisitive muzzle of the sightless
horse—a paralysis of fear all over
his face. But when Bud came forward
and touched his face and stroked it,
the fear vanished, and the old roan
bobbed his tail up and down and wiggled
his head reassuringly and apologetically.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wal, I declar, Bishop,” grinned Bud,
“kin yo’ critter fetch a caper?”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Bishop got leisurely out of his
buggy, pulled down the shafts and tied
up the girth before he spoke. Then he
gave a puckering hitch to his underlip
and deposited in the sand, with a puddling
plunk, the half cup of tobacco juice
that had closed his mouth.</p>

<p class='c008'>He stepped back and said very
sternly:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Whoa, Ben Butler!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Why, he’un’s sleep a’ready,” grinned
Bud.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Bishop glanced at the bowed
head, cocked hind foot and listless tail:
“Sof’nin’ of the brain, Bud,” smiled the
Bishop; “they say when old folks begin
to take it they jus’ go to sleep while
settin’ up talkin’. Now, a horse, Bud,”
he said, striking an attitude for a discussion
on his favorite topic, “a horse
is like a man—he must have some meanness
or he c’u’dn’t live, an’ some goodness
or nobody else c’u’d live. But git
in, Bud, and let’s go along to meetin’—’pears
like it’s gettin’ late.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This was what Bud had been listening
for. This was the treat of the week
for him—to ride to meetin’ with the
Bishop. Bud, a slubber-slave—henpecked
at home, browbeaten and cowed
at the mill, timid, scared, “an’ powerful
slow-mouthed,” as his spouse termed
it, worshipped the old Bishop and had
no greater pleasure in life, after his
hard week’s work, than “to ride to
meetin’ with the old man an’ jes’ hear
him narrate.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Bishop’s great, sympathetic soul
went out to the poor fellow, and though
he had rather spend the next two miles
of Ben Butler’s slow journey to church
in thinking over his sermon, he never
failed, as he termed it, “to pick up charity
even on the road-side,” and it was pretty
to see how the old man would turn
loose his crude histrionic talent to
amuse the slubber. He knew, too, that
Bud was foolish about horses, and that
Ben Butler was his model!</p>

<p class='c008'>They got into the old buggy, and Ben
Butler began to draw it slowly along
the sandy road to the little church, two
miles away up the mountain side.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bud was now in the seventh heaven.
He was riding behind Ben Butler, the
greatest horse in the world, and talking
to the Bishop, the only person who ever
heard the sound of his voice, save in
deprecatory and scary grunts.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was touching to see how the old
man humored the simple and imposed-upon
creature at his side. It was beautiful
to see how, forgetting himself and
his sermon, he prepared to entertain,
in his quaint way, this slave to the slubbing
machine.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bud looked fondly at the Bishop—then
admiringly at Ben Butler. He drew a
long breath of pure air, and sitting on
the edge of the seat, prepared to jump
if necessary, for Bud was mortally
afraid of being in a runaway, and his
scared eyes seemed to be looking for
the soft places in the road.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bishop,” he drawled after a while,
“huc-cum you name sech a hoss”—pointing
to the old roan—“sech a grand hoss,
for sech a man—sech a man as he was,”
he added humbly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did you ever notice Ben Butler’s
eyes, Bud?” asked the old man knowingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Blind,” said Bud sadly, shaking his
head—“too bad—too bad—great—great
hoss!”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Yes, but the leds, Bud—that hoss,
Ben Butler there, holds a world’s record—he’s
the only cock-eyed hoss in the
world.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You don’t say so—that critter!—cock-eyed?”
Bud laughed and slapped his
leg gleefully. “Didn’t I always tell you
so? World’s record—great—great!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Then it broke gradually through on
Bud’s dull mind.</p>

<p class='c008'>He slapped his leg again. “An’ him—his
namesake—he was cock-eyed, too—I
seed him onct at New ’Leens.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Don’t you never trust a cock-eyed
man, Bud. He’ll flicker on you in the
home-stretch. I’ve tried it an’ it never
fails. Love him, but don’t trust him.
The world is full of folks we oughter
love, but not trust.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“No—I never will,” said Bud as
thoughtfully as he knew how to be—“nor
a cock-eyed ’oman neither. My wife’s
cock-eyed,” he added.</p>

<p class='c008'>He was silent a moment. Then he
showed the old man a scar on his forehead:
“She done that last month—busted
a plate on my head.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s bad,” said the Bishop consolingly—“but
you ortenter aggravate her,
Bud.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That’s so—I ortenter—least-wise, not
whilst there’s any crockery in the
house,” said Bud sadly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There’s another thing about this
hoss,” went on the Bishop—“he’s always
spoony on mules. He ain’t happy if he
can’t hang over the front gate spoonin’
with every stray mule that comes along.
There’s old long-eared Lize that he’s
dead stuck on—if he c’u’d write he’d be
composin’ a sonnet to her ears, like
poets do to their lady love’s—callin’
them Star Pointers of a Greater Hope,
I reck’n, an’ all that. Why, he’d ruther
hold hands by moonlight with some old
Maria mule than to set up by lamplight
with a thoroughbred filly.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Great—great!” said Bud slapping his
leg—“didn’t I tell you so?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“So I named him Ben Butler when he
was born. That was right after the
war, an’ I hated old Ben so an’ loved
hosses so, I thought ef I’d name my colt
for old Ben maybe I’d learn to love him,
in time.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Bud shook his head. “That’s ag’in
nature, Bishop.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“But I have, Bud—sho’ as you are
born I love old Ben Butler.” He lowered
his voice to an earnest whisper: “I ain’t
never told you what he done for po’
Cap’n Tom.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Never heurd o’ Cap’n Tom.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The Bishop looked hurt. “Never mind,
Bud, you wouldn’t understand. But
maybe you will ketch this. Listen now.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Bud listened intently with his head on
one side.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I ain’t never hated a man in my life
but what God has let me live long
enough to find out I was in the wrong—dead
wrong. There are Jews and
Yankees. I useter hate ’em worse’n sin—but
now what do you reckon?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“One on ’em busted a plate on yo’
head?” asked Bud.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jesus Christ was a Jew, an’ Cap’n
Tom jined the Yankees.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Bud,” he said cheerily after a pause,
“did I ever tell you the story of this
here Ben Butler here?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Bud’s eyes grew bright and he slapped
his leg again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well,” said the old man, brightening
up into one of his funny moods, “you
know my first wife was named Kathleen—Kathleen
Galloway when she was a
gal, an’ she was the pretties’ gal in
the settlement an’ could go all the gaits
both saddle an’ harness. She was han’som’
as a three-year-old an’ cu’d out-dance,
out-ride, out-sing an’ out-flirt any
other gal that ever come down the pike.
When she got her Sunday harness on
an’ began to move, she made all the
other gals look like they were nailed
to the road-side. It’s true, she needed a
little weight in front to balance her,
an’ she had a lot of ginger in her
make-up, but she was straight and
sound, didn’t wear anything but the harness
an’ never teched herself anywhere
nor cross-fired nor hit her knees.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Good—great!” said Bud, slapping his
leg.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, she was beautiful, Bud, with that
silky hair that ’ud make a thoroughbred
filly’s look coarse as sheep’s wool, an’
two mischief-lovin’ eyes an’ a heart that
was all gold. Bud—Bud”—and there
was a huskiness in the old man’s voice—“I
know I can tell you because it will
never come back to me ag’in, but I love
that Kathleen now as I did then. A
man may marry many times, but he
can never love but once. Sometimes
it’s his fust wife, sometimes his secon’,
an’ often it’s the sweetheart he never
got—but he loved only one of ’em the
right way, an’ up yander, in some other
star, where spirits that are alike meet
in one eternal wedlock, they’ll be one
there forever.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Her daddy, ole man Galloway, had a
thoroughbred filly that he named Kathleena
for his daughter, an’ she c’u’d do
anything that the gal left out. An’ one
day when she took the bit in her teeth
an’ run a quarter in twenty-five seconds,
she sot ’em all wild an’ lots of fellers
tried to buy the filly an’ get the old
man to throw in the gal for her keep
an’ board.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I was one of ’em. I was clerkin’ for
the old man an’ boardin’ in the house,
an’ whenever a young feller begins to
board in a house where there is a thoroughbred
gal, the nex’ thing he knows
he’ll be—”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Buckled in the traces,” cried Bud
slapping his leg gleefully, at this, his
first product of brilliancy.</p>

<p class='c008'>The old man smiled: “’Pon my word,
Bud, you’re gittin’ so smart. I don’t
know what I’ll be doin’ with you—so
’riginal an’ smart. Why, you’ll quit
keepin’ an old man’s company—like me.
I won’t be able to entertain you at all.
But, as I was sayin’ the next thing
he knows, he’ll be one of the family.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So me an’ Kathleen, we soon got
spoony an’ wanted to marry. Lots of
’em wanted to marry her, but I drawed
the pole an’ was the only one she’d take
as a runnin’ mate. So I went after the
old man this a way: I told him I’d buy
the filly if he’d give me Kathleen. I
never will forgit what he said: ‘They
ain’t narry one of ’em for sale, swap or
hire, an’ I wish you young fellers ’ud
tend to yo’ own business an’ let my
fillies alone. I’m gwinter bus’ the
wurl’s record wid ’em both—Kathleena
the runnin’ record an Kathleen the gal
record, so be damn to you an’ don’t pester
me no mo’.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Did he say damn?” asked Bud aghast—that
such a word should ever come
from the Bishop.</p>

<p class='c008'>“He sho’ did, Bud. I wouldn’t lie
about the old man, now that he’s dead.
It ain’t right to lie about dead people—even
to make ’em say nice an’ proper
things they never thought of whilst
alive. If we’d stop lyin’ about the ungodly
dead an’ tell the truth about ’em,
maybe the livin’ ’u’d stop tryin’ to foller
after ’em in that respect. As it is, every
one of ’em knows that no matter how
wicked he lives there’ll be a lot o’ nice
lies told over him after he’s gone, an’
a monument erected, maybe, to tell how
good he was. An’ there’s another lot
of half pious folks in the wurl it ’u’d
help—kind o’ sissy pious folks—that
jus’ do manage to miss all the fun in
this world an’ jus’ are mean enough to
ketch hell in the nex’. Get religion,
but don’t get the sissy kind. So I am
for tellin’ it about old man Galloway
jus’ as he was.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You orter heard him swear. Bud—it
was part of his religion. An’ wherever
he is to-day in that other world,
he is at it yet, for in that other life, Bud,
we’re just ourselves on a bigger scale
than we are in this. He used to cuss
the clerks around the store jus’ from
habit, an’ when I went to work for him
he said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Young man, maybe I’ll cuss you out
some mornin’, but don’t pay no ’tention
to it—it’s just a habit I’ve got into, an’
the boys all understand it.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Glad you told me,’ I said, lookin’
him square in the eye—‘one confidence
deserves another. I’ve got a nasty habit
of my own, but I hope you won’t pay
no ’tention to it, for it’s a habit, an’ I
can’t help it. I don’t mean nothin’ by
it, an’ the boys all understand it, but
when a man cusses me I allers knock
him down—do it befo’ I think’—I said—‘jes’
a habit I’ve got.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, he never cussed me all the time
I was there. My stock went up with
the old man an’ my chances was good
to get the gal, if I hadn’t made a fool
hoss-trade; for with old man Galloway
a good hoss-trade covered all the multitude
of sins in a man that charity now
does in religion. In them days a man
might have all the learnin’ and virtues
an’ graces, but if he c’u’dn’t trade hosses
he was tinklin’ brass an’ soundin’ cymbal
in that community.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The man that throwed the silk into
me was Jud Carpenter—the same fellow
that’s now the whipper-in for these mills.
Now, don’t be scared,” said the old man
soothingly as Bud’s scary eyes looked
about him and he clutched the buggy
as if he would jump out—“he’ll not
pester you now—he’s kept away from
me ever since. He swapped me a black
hoss with a star an’ snip that
looked like the genuine thing, but was
about the neatest turned gold-brick that
was ever put on an unsuspectin’ millionaire.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, in the trade he simply robbed
me of a fine mare I had, that cost me
one-an’-a-quarter. Kathleen an’ me was
already engaged, but when old man Galloway
heard of it, he told me the jig
was up an’ no such double-barrel idiot
as I was sh’u’d ever leave any of my
colts in the Galloway paddock—that
when he looked over his gran’-chillun’s
pedigree he didn’t wanter see all of ’em
crossin’ back to the same damned fool!
Oh, he was nasty. He said that my colts
was dead sho’ to be luffers with wheels
in their heads, an’ when pinched they’d
quit, an’ when collared they’d lay down.
That there was a yaller streak in me
that was already pilin’ up coupons on
the future for tears and heartaches an’
maybe a gallows or two, an’ a lot of
uncomplimentary talk of that kind.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, Kathleen cried, an’ I wept, an’
I’ll never forgit the night she gave me
a little good-bye kiss out under the big
oak tree an’ told me we’d hafter part.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The old man maybe sized me up all
right as bein’ a fool, but he missed it on
my bein’ a quitter. I had no notion of
being fired an’ blistered an’ turned out
to grass that early in the game. I wrote
her a poem every other day, an’ lied between
heats, till the po’ gal was nearly
crazy, an’ when I finally got it into her
head that if it was a busted blood vessel
with the old man, it was a busted heart
with me, she cried a little mo’ an’ consented
to run off with me an’ take the
chances of the village doctor cuppin’
the old man at the right time.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The old lady was on my side and
helped things along. I had everything
fixed even to the moon, which was
shinin’ jes’ bright enough to carry us
to the Justice’s without a lantern, some
three miles away, an’ into the nex’
county.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I’ll never fergit how the night looked
as I rode over after her, how the wildflowers
smelt, an’ the fresh dew on the
leaves. I remember that I even heard
a mockin’-bird wake up about midnight
as I tied my hoss to a lim’ in the orchard
nearby, an’ slipped aroun’ to meet Kathleen
at the bars behin’ the house. It
was a half mile to the house an’ I was
slippin’ through the sugar-maple trees
along the path we’d both walked so often
befo’, when I saw what I thought was
Kathleen comin’ towards me. I ran to
meet her. It wa’n’t Kathleen, but her
mother—an’ she told me to git in a
hurry, that the old man knew all, had
locked Kathleen up in the kitchen,
turned the brindle dog loose in the yard,
an’ was hidin’ in the woods nigh the
barn, with his gun loaded with bird-shot,
an’ that if I went any further the
chances were I’d not sit down agin for
a year. She had slipped around through
the woods just to warn me.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Of course I wanted to fight an’ take
her anyway—kill the dog an’ the old
man, storm the kitchen an’ run off with
Kathleen in my arms as they do in
novels. But the old lady said she didn’t
want the dog hurt—it being a valuable
coon-dog—and that I was to go away
out of the county an’ wait for a better
time.</p>

<p class='c008'>“It mighty nigh broke me up, but I
decided the old lady was right an’ I’d
go away. But ’long towards the shank
of the night, after I had put up my hoss,
the moon was still shinin’, an’ I c’u’dn’t
sleep for thinkin’ of Kathleen. I stole
afoot over to her house just to look at
her window. The house was all quiet
an’ even the brindle dog was asleep.
I threw kisses at her bed-room window,
but even then I c’u’dn’t go away, so I
slipped around to the barn and laid down
in the hay to think over my hard luck.
My heart ached an’ burned an’ I was
nigh dead with love.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I wondered if I’d ever get her, if
they’d wean her from me, an’ give her
to the rich little feller whose fine farm
j’ined the old man’s an’ who the old
man was wuckin’ fur—whether the two
wouldn’t over-persuade her whilst I was
gone. For I’d made up my mind I’d
go befo’ daylight—that there wasn’t anything
else for me to do.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I was layin’ in the hay, an’ boylike,
the tears was rollin’ down. If I c’u’d
only kiss her han’ befo’ I left—if I c’u’d
only see her face at the winder!</p>

<p class='c008'>“I must have sobbed out loud, for jus’
then I heard a gentle, sympathetic
whinny an’ a cold, inquisitive little muzzle
was thrust into my face, as I lay
on my back with my heart nearly busted.
It was Kathleena, an’ I rubbed my hot
face against her cool cheek—for it
seemed so human of her to come an’ try
to console me, an’ I put my arms around
her neck an’ kissed her silky mane an’
imagined it was Kathleen’s hair.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I was heart-broke an’ silly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Then all at onct a thought came to
me, an’ I slipped the bridle an’ saddle
on her an’ led her out at the back door,
an’ I scratched this on a slip of paper
an’ stuck it on the barn do’:</p>

<p class='c008'>The old man smiled, and Bud slapped

<p class='c008'>“They say it ’u’d done you good to have

know from that day that this life ain’t
all, that we’ll live agin as sho’ as God
lives an’ is just—an’ no man can doubt
that. No—no—Bud, this life ain’t all,
because it’s God’s unvarying law to finish
things. That tree there is finished,
an’ them birds, they are finished, an’
that flower by the road-side an’ the mountain
yonder an’ the world an’ the stars
an’ the sun. An’ we’re mo’ than they
be, Bud—even the tiniest soul, like Kathleen’s
little one that jes’ opened its
eyes an’ smiled an’ died, when its
mammy died. It had something that
the trees an’ birds an’ mountains didn’t
have—a soul—an’ don’t you kno’ He’ll
finish all such lives up yonder? He’ll
pay it back a thousandfold for what He
cuts off here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Bud wept because the tears were running
down the old man’s cheeks. He
wanted to say something, but he could
not speak. That queer feeling that came
over him at times and made him silent
had come again.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Bishop laughed outright as his
mind went back again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well,” he went on reminiscently, “I’ll
have to finish my tale an’ tell you how
I throwed the cold steel into Jud Carpenter
when I got back. I saw I had
it to do, to work back into my daddy-in-law’s
graces an’ save my reputation.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Now, Jud had lied to me an’ swindled
me terribly, when he put off that
old no-count hoss on me. Of course, I
might have sued him, for a lie is a microbe
which naturally develops into a
lawyer’s fee. But while it’s a terrible
braggart, it’s really cowardly an’ delicate,
an’ will die of lock-jaw if you only
pick its thumb.</p>

<p class='c008'>“So I breshed up that old black to
split-silk fineness, an’ turned him over
to Dr. Sykes, a friend of mine living in
the next village. An’ I said to the Doctor,
‘Now remember he is yo’ hoss until
Jud Carpenter comes an’ offers you two
hundred dollars for him.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Will he be fool enough to do it?’
he asked, as he looked the old counterfeit
over.</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Wait and see,’ I said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I said nothin’, laid low an’ froze
an’ it wa’n’t long befo’ Jud come ’round
as I ’lowed he’d do. He expected me to
kick an’ howl; but as I took it all so
nice he didn’t understand it. Nine times
out of ten the best thing to do when the
other feller has robbed you is to freeze.
The hunter on the plain knows the value
of that, an’ that he can freeze an’ make
a deer walk right up to him, to find out
what he is. Why, a rabbit will do it, if
you jump him quick, an’ he gets confused
an’ don’t know jes’ what’s up;
an’ so Jud come as I thort he’d do. He
couldn’t stan’ it no longer, an’ he wanted
to rub it in. He brought his crowd to
enjoy the fun.</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Oh, Mr. Watts,’ he said grinnin’,
‘how do you like a coal black stump-sucker?’</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Well,’ I said, indifferent enough—‘I’ve
knowed good judges of hosses to make
a hones’ mistake now an’ then, an’ sell
a hoss to a customer with the heaves
thinkin’ he’s a stump-sucker. But it ’u’d
turn out to be only the heaves an’ easily
cured.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Is that so?’ said Jud, changing his
tone.</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Yes,’ I said, ‘an’ I’ve knowed better
judges of hosses to sell a nervous hoss
for a balker that had been balked only
onct by a rattle head. But in keerful
hands I’ve seed him git over it,’ I said,
indifferent like.</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Indeed?’ said Jud.</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Yes, Jud,’ said I, ‘I’ve knowed real
hones’ hoss traders to make bad breaks
of that kind, now and then—honest intentions an’ all that, but bad judgment,’—sez
I—‘an’ I’ll cut it short by sayin’
that I’ll just give you two an’ a half
if you’ll match that no-count wind-broken
black as you thort that you swapped me.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Do you mean it?’ said Jud, solemn-like.</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘I’ll make a bond to that effect,’ I
said solemnly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Jud went off thoughtful. In a week
or so he come back. He hung aroun’
a while an’ said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘I was up in the country the other
day, an’ do you kno’ I saw a dead match
for yo’ black? Only a little slicker an’
better lookin’—same star an’ white hind
foot. As nigh like him as one black-eyed
pea looks like another.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Jud,’ I said, ‘I never did see two
hosses look exactly alike. You’re honestly
mistaken.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘They ain’t a hair’s difference,’ he
said. ‘He’s a little slicker than yours—that’s
all—better groomed than the
one in yo’ barn.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘I reckon he is,’ said I, for I knew
very well there wa’n’t none in my barn.
‘That’s strange,’ I went on, ‘but you kno’
what I said.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Do you still hold to that offer?’ he
axed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘I’ll make bond with my daddy-in-law
on it,’ I said.</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Nuff said,’ an’ Jud was gone. The
next day he came back leading the black,
slicker an’ hence no-counter than ever,
if possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Look at him,’ he said, proudly—‘a
dead match for yourn. Jes’ han’ me
that two an’ a half an’ take him. You
now have a team worth a thousan’.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“I looked the hoss over plum’ surprised
like.</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Why, Jud,’ I said as softly as I cu’d,
for I was nigh to bustin’, an’ I had a lot
of friends come to see the sho’, an’ they
standin’ ’round stickin’ their old hats
in their mouths to keep from explodin’—‘Why,
Jud, my dear friend,’ I said, ‘ain’t
you kind o’ mistaken about this? I said
a match for the black, an’ it peers to
me like you’ve gone an’ bought the
black hisse’f an’ is tryin’ to put him
off on me. No—no—my kind frien’,
you’ll not fin’ anything no-count enuff to
be his match on this terrestrial ball.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“By this time you c’u’d have raked
Jud’s eyes off his face with a soap-gourd.</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘What? W-h-a-t? He—why—I bought
him of Dr. Sykes.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Why, that’s funny,’ I said, ‘but it
comes in handy all round. If you’d told
me that the other day I might have told
you,’ I said—‘yes, I might have, but I
doubt it—that I’d loaned him to Dr.
Sykes an’ told him whenever you offered
him two hundred cash for him to let
him go. Jes’ keep him,’ sez I, ‘till you
find his mate, an’ I’ll take an oath to
buy ’em.’”</p>

<p class='c008'>Bud slapped his leg an’ yelled with
delight.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Whew,” said the Bishop—“not so
loud. We’re at the church.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But remember, Bud, it’s good policy
allers to freeze. When you’re in doubt—freeze!”</p>

<p class='c012'>[Note: Mr. Wilkes has made a life
study of this subject and speaks from
a practical standpoint, at the request of
the editor of Trotwood’s. He has, of
course, confined his paper to the hill lands
of the Middle South; but in the publicity
which will be given by this publication,
it is to be hoped other sections of the
South will take advantage of this wonderful
opportunity where their conditions
are favorable.—Ed.]</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>Nature never gave to any people
a fairer heritage than to the farmers
of Middle Tennessee. With a rich
soil, a mild climate and an abundant
rainfall, it is in truth a garden spot.
Adapted to the growth of nearly every
product necessary for man’s sustenance,
covered with forests, underlaid with
minerals and phosphates, midway between
the cold blasts of the North and
the excessive heat of the South, with
cold, pure water pouring from under
every hill, and not a taint of malaria
in the atmosphere, it is the ideal farmer’s
home. With all its advantages and
opportunities there should be the highest
degree of success and prosperity, and
the owner of a Middle Tennessee farm
should be the happiest and most contented
man that lives. That such is not
the case in recent years, however, is a
lamentable fact.</p>

<p class='c008'>Distinctly an agricultural people, prosperity
depends upon the success of the
farmers, and that they are not prospering
as they should is an undeniable fact.
The reason for this can be found in the
fact that Tennessee farmers have failed
to realize the results of the marvelous
expansion and upheaval of the industrial
conditions that have come as the result
of building railways and the invention
of labor-saving machinery. There was
a time when the owners of these rich
hills and valleys could successfully meet
all competitors in the markets then accessible,
and growing all their own
supplies, the sale of their surplus products
kept the balance always in their
favor. But with the building of railways
that opened up vast acres of rich territory,
and the invention of machinery
that multiplied many fold the products
of labor, new centers of production were
made accessible, and where Tennesseans
once had the markets all to themselves,
new competitors came in, and with this
new competition came the beginning of
the end of their supremacy in growing
many standard products. Failing to
realize the new state of affairs, and
unwilling to acknowledge defeat in lines
they had so long excelled in, they continued
their efforts to compete with
these new forces in the same lines of
production, and in the unequal contest
sacrificed much of their rich soil rather
than be driven from their beaten paths
into lines to which they were strangers.
They failed to look facts squarely in the
face and to recognize their true condition,
and continued to struggle against
an ever-increasing balance that in the
end could only bring disaster. Take a
plain business view of the situation and
consider the chances an average Middle
Tennessee farmer has in growing
grain crops upon his rolling land and
steep hillsides, rich though they be,
when he must meet in competitive markets
grain grown in that great area
known as the West, with its broad, level
fields and virgin soil, where the labor of
one man controlling perfect working machinery
so far surpasses the same labor
upon his restricted, rough area. Labor
is always the greatest cost of production,
and the physical character of a large
part of Middle Tennessee will always
prevent that economical use of machinery
that is available to the Western
farmer in growing grain and other farm
products in the handling of which machinery
is effective. No people can permanently
prosper who must meet in
competitive markets the cheaper grown
products of more favored sections, for
while they may have a degree of prosperity
in periods of high prices like the
present, yet, when the low price periods
come, as come they will, they bring loss
and often ruin to the weak competitor,
for it is Nature’s law that only the fittest
shall survive. What then is to be the
future of Middle Tennessee farming?
This question is hard to answer, not for
a lack of answer to the question, nor for
a lack of products that can be grown
with success, but rather because there
are so many ways to meet it, and so
many products to select from, and such
a variety of soils to select for, that it is
more a question of adaptability and location,
and the fitness and taste of the
individual than a want of ways to meet
the issue. There are many owners of
large, level farms that may still compete
in growing all ordinary farm products,
and there are many who grow
certain lines of live stock and have
special markets for their surplus, and
others whose soil and location make
profitable different lines; and to these
classes changes in their mode of farming
may not be desirable.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the majority of Middle Tennessee
farmers have only small farms, all more
or less rolling, and many of them too
rough and steep for the economical use
of machinery, and for these some change
in their system is an absolute necessity.</p>

<p class='c008'>There should be grown upon every
farm two distinct lines of products—the
one for home consumption, for these
can always be utilized for much more
than their market value, and Tennessee
farmers as a rule pursue the right
course in regard to their own supplies;
but it is in the products that are grown
for market that the mistake has been
made, and they must change this line,
and grow those that give greater returns
per acre, and a greater value for the
labor, and quit growing those lines that
bring them in direct competition with
labor that is supplemented by the use
of machinery.</p>

<p class='c008'>While much of the virgin soil has been
washed from the rich hills of this Middle
Tennessee country in the endeavor
to meet competition and to regain lost
supremacy, yet its natural advantages
are so great and the soil is so richly
stored with the elements of plant food
that it recuperates rapidly, and when
under a new system, with intensive
farming, and a proper rotation and selection
of crops that suit its varied soil,
and in the sale of which her farmers can
stand upon the top round of the ladder,
and look down upon, instead of up to,
their competitors, as they do now, then
will this grand commonwealth flourish
as it never did, and its farmers will reap
a harvest of prosperity unsurpassed by
that of any farmers upon earth.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among the many products that can
be grown with the greatest assurance
of success, I know of none with results
more certain and sure to give rich returns
for the labor bestowed, nor more
exempt from hurtful competition, than
that of growing the early varieties of
apples upon the hills and uplands of
this great basin. Ninety-five per cent
of all the apples grown are winter varieties,
and with the utmost care in handling,
and the best facilities that cold
storage can give for keeping them, there
is a period of several months in the
early summer when the markets are
bare of apples, except a remnant of
stale cold storage stock; and it is at
this scarce period when prices are highest,
competition least and demand greatest,
that our early apples are at their
best, and supply an urgent demand for
the fruit acids so necessary at this season
to the people of cold climates, to
eliminate the effects of living many
months upon rich, heating foods. Fruit
acids are Nature’s remedy for many ills,
and they are indispensable where the
winters are long and cold; and in no
fruit are these acids so rich and so well
adapted to the needs of man as in the
apple; and no apple is ready for use
at so opportune a time as these Tennessee
grown early kinds. They are ready
for use at a season when all fruits are
scarce, and the market is an open one,
from which Tennesseans can reap a
rich harvest if they will take advantage
of the opportunity presented. Only a
few years since fruits were a luxury of
the rich, and were not considered articles
of food; but as their value became
known under the modern rational ideas
of living, they have quickly become necessities;
and where obtainable, are staple
foods upon the tables of every class
and condition of man. Among fruits the
apple stands pre-eminent for its many
uses and great healthfulness; and he is
a poor provider indeed who does not supply
his family with this, the most healthful
and palatable dish that can go upon
his table in some of its many prepared
forms. The supply of apples has not
increased in the same ratio that consumption
has, for it takes time to grow
orchards, and older orchards die; but
the demand is an ever increasing one.
These early apples sell much higher
than the winter varieties, and the territory
that can grow them is so limited
that low prices need not be feared. They
cost much less to grow, for they mature
before the drouths and storms of summer
come, and are less subject to damage
by insects and fungus disease.
Middle Tennessee is the heart of the
territory that can grow choice apples
that mature in that bare season, the
months of June and July, and should,
and I believe will, be the center of this
industry in the years to come. Farther
South the apple does not grow with any
success, and north of us they do not mature
in time to compete, and there is
only a small zone east and west of us
that can grow them, and we have at
least two months with practically no
competition, and an unlimited demand.
With the rapid and constantly improving
facilities for moving this class of freight
these apples can be put into any of the
cities in perfect condition, shipped in
ordinary cars without the heavy ice
changes that most fruits must bear. With
the limited area available for their production,
and the small amount now
grown, it will take years to furnish an
adequate supply; and the greatest danger
will be the scarcity and not an overproduction,
for with greater supplies
the buyers will come and the markets
will be at our doors.</p>

<p class='c008'>With more growers and greater supplies
will come organization. Associations
will be formed, and instead of haphazard
individual shipments, the crop
will be handled in a systematic way,
and be distributed to meet the needs of
the different markets. The railroads
will be ready helpers along these lines,
for they realize the importance to their
own interests of fostering enterprises
of this kind. The L. &amp; N. R. R. is
now doing a great work in encouraging
the increased growth of this class of
products and give assurance of their
ready co-operation at all times. This
industry has passed the experimental
stage, and it is an assured fact that
these early apples will become a standard
production of Middle Tennessee. It
has been demonstrated by practical tests
that the hills of Tennessee are especially
adapted to this class of fruits, and
the great success that has followed the
efforts of the few who had the foresight
to anticipate the coming results, and
the nerve to back their views is a sure
indication of what the future will develop
along this line.</p>

<p class='c008'>The pioneer in this line of business was
Mr. W. L. Wilkes, of Spring Hill, Tennessee,
and the success that he achieved has
been followed by the planting of many
large orchards around him that will
soon be yielding a harvest to their owners.
He is too modest to say much of
the profits, but the facts are so patent
that his neighbors are following his example
and a revolution is taking place
in the farming of that section. He
claims that there is better profit in
growing these apples now than when he
began, for the business was then a
venture, and the fruit was unknown
upon the market, but now growing them
is an assured fact, and there is a demand
for all that can be supplied. The
question of varieties, too, has been settled
by experience, while then it was a
matter of test.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fruit well grown and handled has
ever been the most profitable of all
crops; and certainly a better opportunity
was never offered to any people
than this one offers to the farmers of
Tennessee and other Southern States.
Knowing what has already been done
and the success already achieved, it
offers an opportunity to the man who
has a taste for fruit growing and has
the energy and capacity to properly
care for an orchard, and the patience
to wait for its fruiting, an assurance
of success greater than that of almost
any other business. And when his orchard
has passed its fruitful age, and
ceased to be profitable, it leaves the
soil as rich as that of a virgin forest, as
an inheritance for his children.</p>

<p class='c008'>It must not be inferred that good results
will be had in growing apples, or
any kinds of fruit without up-to-date
methods of culture; for fruits do not take
kindly to careless and slovenly ways.
There are many details necessary to success,
and explicit directions cannot be
given in an article of this kind that will
be a sufficient guide to those who have no
practical knowledge of fruit growing.
There are some general rules, however,
that apply in all cases, and that cannot
be too strongly emphasized. No one
should go into commercial fruit growing
without first considering well their surroundings
as to soil, location, shipping
facilities and other matters of that kind,
and more especially to their own fitness
for the business. A man must have an
adaptability to, and a taste for, any
business to make a success of it, for each
individual has, more or less, an adaptation
for some calling; and many of the
failures in life are the result of the individual’s
failing to get into the right
channel.</p>

<p class='c008'>The right person with the proper surroundings,
having settled the question of
planting in the affirmative, there will
come many matters of detail that will
require the exercise of common sense
and judgment, and for the practice of
which no specific rules can be given. I
do not know any better way to help beginners
than to tell them some of the
things they should not do, and thereby
prevent their making some costly mistakes.</p>

<p class='c008'>The most important question to be decided
by a commercial planter is that of
varieties, for they must be of the kinds
to suit the market demands, must be
regular bearers and barrel-fillers, and
must ripen in succession. Don’t plant
many varieties, for they must be shipped
in carloads, and each variety should be
ample for that purpose. Don’t plant novelties,
the kinds that have all the good
points and that never fail to bear, regardless
of frosts and freezes, and are so often
palmed off at fancy prices by smooth-talking
salesmen who always have the
perfect kinds; for when your “perfect
kinds” begin to show up their crops of
crabs and seedlings your smooth agent
will be far away practicing his games
upon other suckers. The perfect apple
is yet a vision of the future, and need
not be expected until the perfect man
comes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Confine your commercial planting to
well tested kinds that have succeeded in
locations similar to yours. Don’t buy
inferior trees because they are cheap.
You are planting for a lifetime, and your
time and money will be worse than
wasted trying to grow profitable orchards
from inferior stock. Life is too short to
waste it waiting for diseased trees to
drag along for years and then die just
as their fruitings should begin. Buy the
best trees that you can get; for if you
are not willing to pay a fair price for
good stock, don’t go into the business;
for that very fact is conclusive proof
that you have missed your calling. Having
made your selection of varieties, and
bought good trees, don’t let them lie
around exposed to sun and air until half
dead and then blame the nurseryman
if they fail to grow. A tree is a thing
of life and loses vitality every hour
it is exposed, and it will need all of its
vitality in adapting itself to its new home,
and to recover from its rude removal
from where it grew. Don’t buy old trees,
thinking you will gain a year’s time
in growth and fruiting, for such will not
be the case. All experienced planters
agree that one-year apple trees will live
better, grow better and bear fruit as
early as older ones. They can be bought
for less money, are easier to plant and
can be pruned to grow the style of tree
you want. Only the thrifty, healthy
trees are large enough for planting at
one year old, and in buying them you run
no risk of getting inferior stock.</p>

<p class='c008'>Don’t plant without a thorough preparation
of the soil, for no after care will
compensate for the bad effect of careless
preparation. The first year is the crucial
period in the life of a tree; it has lost
in removal many of its roots, and practically
all of those fine, fibrous feeders
through which it drank life from the soil;
and while nature has stored in its cells
a reserve supply of vitality, yet it needs
every aid that can be given to enable it
to overcome the loss of roots and the
shock of removal and to succeed in its
efforts to become established in its new
home. Do not forget that the success or
failure of your orchard will be largely
owing to the manner of planting and to
the treatment that it gets during the
first year.</p>

<p class='c008'>Having planted first-class, one-year trees
in well prepared soil, cut them down to
stubs eighteen to twenty-four inches
high and let them branch close to the
ground, for if there is a single reason
for growing a long-bodied tree I have
never heard it. On the contrary, there
are many reasons against it. Let every
twig that starts grow the first year, for
they will be needed to furnish leaves to
assimilate the food taken up by the roots,
and to return the solid part to increase
the growth of trees and root. You have
now only the question of cultivation, and
that should be the best that you can
give. Plant the orchard in some suitable
crop, preferably a low growing one, that
requires hoe work, but leave ample space
next to<a id='t296'></a> the trees for continuous cultivation,
and keep that space clear of grass and
weeds, for the trees cannot compete in
their new surroundings with these gross
drinkers of the water that is in the soil,
that will be so badly needed to start
their growth. Should the summer be dry,
keep a dust mulch by frequent cultivation
with light harrows or sweeps until the
fall rains come, and if your soil is reasonably
fertile, the growth the trees will
make will be a surprise and pleasure,
and the hardest period in growing your
orchard will be a thing of the past. Get
all the information you can from practical
fruit growers; study the bulletins of
the National Agricultural Department
and of the State Experimental Station;
read the papers and magazines that treat
of these subjects; seek every available
source of information; and having digested
the opinions and practices of others,
formulate your own opinions, map
out the course you believe most suitable
to your surroundings and follow the dictates
of your own judgment. Continue
this line of action through the coming
years, adapting your methods to suit
the condition of your orchard from year
to year, and if you have exercised good
common sense success is as certain to
reward your efforts as anything in this
life can be certain that is dependent upon

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>Knowing that the method of purchase
and the kind of horse required
in the military service of the
United States is a matter of interest to
both horse breeders and dealers, the
scarcity of horses meeting these requirements
has caused me to write this article,
for Trotwood’s.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>First, as to Method of Purchase.</h3>

<p class='c015'>The buying of horses is done by the
Quartermaster’s Department of the army,
the number of horses bought at any one
time depending on the needs of the service
at that time. This number may vary
from one to two to hundreds and even
thousands. Bids are advertised for, giving
the number of horses required, and
the date on which they are to be delivered
to the government. Then contractors
or dealers in horses put in their bids
at the prices at which they will furnish
the required number of horses. The bids
are opened on a certain date, and the
lowest bidder is given the contract. Soon
after the contract is awarded, a Board
of Officers is appointed to inspect and
buy the horses that the contractor brings
before the Board, providing, of course,
that the horses fulfill the specifications
of the contract.</p>

<p class='c008'>A horse purchasing Board usually consists
of from three to five members. One
of these officers is from the Quartermaster’s
Department, U. S. Army, the others
being usually members of the Cavalry
or Artillery; there is also a Veterinarian
to inspect the horses in regard to soundness.
He may be either a Quartermaster’s
Veterinarian (civilian) or a Veterinarian
of the Cavalry or Artillery.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>Usual Requirements of Horses Purchased.</h3>

<p class='c015'>The horses bought consist principally
of two types, viz.: the Cavalry horse,
weighing from 950 to 1,150 pounds; and
the Artillery horse, weighing from 1050
to 1300 pounds.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cavalry Horse: The requirements of
most contracts say that the horses must
be sound and well-bred; gentle under
the saddle; free from vicious habits, with
free and prompt action at the walk, trot
and canter; without blemish or defect;
with easy mouth and gait, and otherwise
to conform to the following description:
a gelding of uniform or hardy color; in
good condition; from 15 ¼ to 16 hands
high; weight from 950 to 1150 pounds;
age from four to eight years; head and
ears small; forehead broad; eyes large
and prominent; vision perfect in every
respect; shoulders long and sloping well
back; chest full, broad and deep; forelegs
straight and standing well under; barrel
large and increasing from girth toward
flank; back short and straight; loins
and haunches broad and muscular; hocks
well bent and under the horse; pasterns
slanting and feet small and sound.</p>

<p class='c008'>Artillery Horse: The Artillery horse has
in general about the same requirements
described for the Cavalry horse, with the
following exceptions: weight being from
1050 to 1300 pounds; should be more of
a draught horse type, as he is required to
work in harness, as well as under saddle;
shoulders should be well-muscled, so as
to give good support to the collar; hindquarter
should be heavy and strong; the
horse should not be what is known as
“beefy” or lymphatic type, but should be
active on his feet and thus able to turn
quickly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Price: The price at present ranges from
a hundred and fifty to a hundred and
seventy-five dollars, probably about a
hundred and sixty for Cavalry horses;
Artillery horses being somewhat higher,
one hundred and sixty-five to one hundred
and eighty dollars.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a horse is shown to the Board
for purchase he is inspected by the Board
first in regard to general conformation,
height, weight, muscular development,
bones, etc.; whether he is high in withers,
thus liable to sore back and bruises
by saddle; length of back, thus whether
able to carry weight; should have short
back with good muscular development;
should not be ewe-necked or bull-necked,
thus hard to control and never making a
good saddle animal.</p>

<p class='c008'>Color: Bays, browns, blacks and sorrels
are the colors best suited for the service.
Grays are sometimes taken, there often
being a gray horse troop in the regiment,
but are not as preferable as the hardier
colors.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sex: Only geldings are accepted, mares
and stallions not being taken, excepting
in times of great necessity, as during
war.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gaits: Walk, trot and canter being the
three gaits prescribed by Army Regulations,
pacing or single-foot horses are
not desired in the service. And here is
where the writer expects to receive Trotwood’s
condemnation. However, if they
do pace they are used in the army, and
the writer has often noticed how quickly
both officers and men will pick a pacing
horse, or one that single-foots for their
mount if allowed to do so, thus proving,
that although we may condemn the pacer
openly, deep down in our hearts we have
a soft spot for him who carries us many
miles with so little effort to himself or
us.</p>

<p class='c008'>After the horse is inspected for general
conformation he is trotted to see his
action, also to see whether he goes sound,
is a paddler, string-halt, interferes, etc.
He is then examined by the Veterinarian
as to defects, age, eyesight, etc. If affected
with any enlargement or weakness
of tendons, hocks as to spavins, thorough-pins,
curbs; examining pasterns for sidebones,
ringbones, quittor, wire scars, etc.,
he is rejected. Sometimes horses are
taken with small splints, also with small
wire scars, especially in this Western
country, where wire fences are so common.
If shod, shoes are removed to examine
feet thoroughly for quarter-crack,
false-quarter, founder, corns, etc. The
eyes are thoroughly examined for any
signs of defects, and in this country, Middle
West, where periodic ophthalmia is
so often seen, it is often hard to tell
where a horse has had a few light attacks
of it in the past, and it is well for the
Veterinarian to reject a horse that is the
least suspicious, thus being on the safe
side.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the horse examined is not sound in
every respect he should be rejected, and
any one desiring to furnish horses for an
army contract had better read carefully
the specifications stated above and then
start out to compare the horses of his
neighborhood with the specifications as
set forth, and he will find that there are
very few that are truly sound and able
to pass muster. Where the horse is accepted
by the purchasing Board he is
branded on the left shoulder with the letters
“U. S.,” and often there is also
branded on his hoof a number, and he is
then ready for shipment to the place
where he is needed for service.</p>

<p class='c008'>Besides the two classes of horses mentioned,
there are also a few very heavy
draught horses bought for two batteries
of siege Artillery, these horses weighing
from 1300 to 1500 pounds. There are also
bought by the government a few horses
for special purposes, as horses used in
the Fire Department and horses used in
the Quartermaster’s Department as drivers,
etc.</p>

<p class='c008'>The specifications of most contracts say
that the horses shall be well bred, but
owing to the scarcity at present of horses,
and the high prices paid for highly bred
horses, we often find in the service horses
that show none or very little indication
of any breeding.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>Disposal of Horses Unfit for Government Service.</h3>

<p class='c015'>Horses that fail to give good service,
or are not able to do the work required,
or are unsuited for the purpose for which
they were bought, are inspected and condemned
and sold at public auction to the
highest bidder; when condemned are
branded with the letters “I. C.” (inspected
and condemned). This brand is placed
on the side of the neck under the mane.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>“Uncle Berry,” continued Mr. Peyton,
“I find, arrived in Tennessee in
the month of February, 1806. In the
spring of that year he made a match
of mile heats, $500 a side, over the Hartsville
course, with Henrietta against Cotton’s
Cygnet, which he won.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The old men of the neighborhood manifested
great sympathy for the young
stranger, and predicted that Lazarus Cotton
would ruin him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This was his first race in Tennessee,
and I witnessed his last, which was run
over the Albion course at Gallatin, in
1862.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Shortly after the race at Hartsville,
Uncle Berry trained a famous quarter
race mare called Sallie Friar, by Jolly
Friar, and made a match for $500 a side,
which was run on Goose Creek, near
the Poison Knob. Sallie was the winner,
and she was afterwards purchased
by Patton Anderson, who ran her with
great success.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In the fall of 1806 Uncle Berry won
with Post Boy the Jockey Club purse,
three mile heats, at Gallatin, beating
General Jackson’s Escape and others.
Escape was the favorite, and the General
and Mrs. Jackson, who were present,
backed him freely. Before this race
he sold Post Boy to Messrs. Richard and
William L. Alexander for $1,000 in the
event of his winning the race, after which
he was withdrawn from the turf. Here
he first met General Jackson and made
a match with him on Henrietta against
Bibb’s mare for $1,000 a side, two mile
heats, equal weights, though the General’s
mare was two years older than
Henrietta, to come off in the spring of
1807 at Clover Bottom. The result proved
that Uncle Berry underrated the horses
and trainers of the Tennessee turf, as
the General’s mare, a thoroughbred
daughter of imported Diomed, won the
race.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The General, though deprived of the
pleasure of being present on that interesting
occasion (having been summoned
as a witness in the trial of Aaron Burr
at Richmond) showed that his heart was
in the race, as appears from a letter to
his friend, Patton Anderson, dated June
16, and published in Parton’s ‘Life of
Jackson,’ from which I quote:</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘At the race I hope you will see Mrs.
Jackson; tell her not to be uneasy. I
will be home as soon as my obedience to
the precept of my country will permit.
I have only to add as to the race, that
the mare of Williams’ is thought here
to be a first-rate animal of her size; but
if she can be put up to it, she will fail in
one heat. It will be then proper to put
her up to all she knows at once.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is Jacksonian. Not many men
would take the responsibility of giving
orders of how to run a race at the distance
of five hundred miles. This error
of underrating an adversary, especially
such an adversary, was a heavy blow
to Uncle Berry, from which he did not
fully recover until he started Haynie’s
Maria, mounted by Monkey Simon,
against him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Not long after this defeat he set out
to search for a horse with which to beat
General Jackson, and purchased from
General Wade Hampton, of South Carolina,
a gelding called Omar, bringing him
to Tennessee. After recruiting his horse
at Captain Alexander’s, near Hartsville,
he went to Nashville and offered General
Jackson a match for $1,000 a side, three
mile heats, according to rule. This the
General declined, offering instead the
same terms as to weight, as in the former
race, in which he was allowed two years’
advantage, a proposition which, of course,
was not accepted.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Unable to get a race in Tennessee,
Uncle Berry took his horse to Natchez,
Miss., traveling through the swamps of
the Chickasaw and Choctaw Nations,
and entered him in a stake, three
mile heats, $200 entrance; but his bad
luck pursued him, and just before the
race his horse snagged his foot, and he
paid forfeit. He remained near Natchez
twelve months and nursed his horse as
no other man could have done, until he
was perfectly restored to health and in
condition for the approaching fall races
of 1808. Writing to Col. George Elliott,
he urged him to come to Natchez and
bring fifteen or twenty horses to bet
on Omar, and also to bring Monkey Simon
to ride him, which Colonel Elliott
did.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Simon’s appearance on the field
alarmed the trainer of the other horse,
who had known him in South Carolina,
and, suspecting that Omar was a bite,
he paid forfeit.</p>

<p class='c008'>“As Simon was a distinguished character,
and made a conspicuous figure on
the turf of Tennessee for many years, it
may be well to give some account of
him. His sobriquet of ‘Monkey Simon’
conveys a forcible idea of his appearance.
He was a native African, and was
brought with his parents when quite
young to South Carolina, before the prohibition
of the slave trade took effect.
In height he was four feet six inches, and
weighed one hundred pounds. He was
a hunchback with very short body and
remarkably long arms and legs. His
color and hair were African, but his features
were not. He had a long head and
face, a high and delicate nose, a narrow
but prominent forehead, and a
mouth indicative of humor and firmness.
It was rumored that Simon was a prince
in his native country. I asked Uncle
Berry the other day if he thought it was
true. He replied, ‘I don’t know; they
said so, and if the princes there had
more sense than the rest he must have
been one of ’em, for he was the smartest
negro I ever saw.’ Colonel Elliott, speaking
of Simon after his death, said he
was the coolest, bravest, wisest rider he
ever saw mount a horse, in which opinion
Uncle Berry fully concurs.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Simon was an inimitable banjo player
and improvised his songs, making humorous
hits at everybody; even General
Jackson did not escape him. Indeed, no
man was his superior in repartee.</p>

<p class='c008'>“On one occasion Colonel Elliott and
James Jackson, with a view to a match
race for $1,000 a side, a dash on two
miles, on Paddy Carey against Colonel
Step’s mare, consented to lend Simon to
ride this mare.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Colonel Step not only gave Simon $100
in the race, but stimulated his pride by
saying they thought they could win races
without him, whereas he knew their success
was owing to Simon’s riding. Somewhat
offended at the idea of being lent
out, and by no means indifferent to the
money, Simon resolved to win the race,
if possible; and nodding his head, said:
‘I’ll show ’em.’ The mare had the speed
of Paddy and took the track, and Simon,
by his consummate skill and by intimidating
the other rider, managed to run
him far out on the turns, while he rested
his mare for a brush on the stretches.</p>

<p class='c008'>“On reaching the last turn Simon found
the mare pretty tired, and Paddy, a game
four miler, locked with her, and he boldly
swung out so far as to leave Paddy
in the fence corner. The boy came up
and attempted to pass on the inside, but
Simon headed him off, and growled at
him all the way down the quarter stretch,
beating him out by a neck. Simon could
come within a hair’s breadth of foul
riding and yet escape the penalty. Colonel
Elliott lost his temper, which he
rarely did, and abused Simon, saying,
‘not satisfied with making Paddy run
forty feet further than the mare on every
turn, he must ride foul all the way
down the quarter stretch.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“The Colonel repeated these charges
until at length Simon answered him with,
‘Well, Colonel Elliott (as he always called
him), I’ve won many a race that way
for you, and it is the first time I ever
heard you object to it.’”</p>

<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c008'>Much has been said and written of
the tenderness and care bestowed by the
Arabs on their favorite horses, but I
doubt whether any Arabian since the
time of the Prophet ever showed such
devotion to his favorite steed as Uncle
Berry to the thoroughbreds under his
care. In fact, his kindly nature embraced
all domestic animals. For many years
he resided on a rich, productive farm
near Gallatin, where he trained Betsy
Malone, Sarah Bladen and many other
distinguished race horses; raised fine
stock and fine crops and proved himself
to be one of the best farmers in the neighborhood.
He had pets of all kinds—huge
hogs that would come and sprawl
themselves to be rubbed, and game chickens
that would feed from his hand, and
followed him if he left home on foot,
often obliging him to return and shut
them up.</p>

<p class='c008'>He raised many celebrated racers for
himself and others, and so judicious was
his system that, at the age of two, they
had almost the maturity of three-year-olds.
His last thoroughbred was a chestnut
filly, foaled in 1859, by Lexington,
dam Sally Roper (the dam of Berry),
which was entered in a stake for three-year-olds,
$500 entrance, two mile heats,
to come off over the Albion course, near
Gallatin, in the fall of 1862. This filly
was, of course, a great favorite with
Uncle Berry. She never associated with
any quadruped after she was weaned, her
master being her only companion. At
two years old she was large and muscular
and very promising, and in the summer
of 1861 I urged Uncle Berry to send
her to the race course (where I had Fannie
McAlister, dam of Muggins, and several
other animals in training), that she
might be gentled and broken to ride. His
reply was: “I have been thinking of your
kind offer—I know she ought to be broke,
but, poor thing! she don’t know anything;
she has never been anywhere, and
has never even been mounted. I am
afraid she will tear herself all to pieces.”
But he finally consented for my colored
trainer, Jack Richlieu, to take her to the
track. On meeting Mrs. Williams a few
days afterwards, I inquired for Uncle
Berry. Her reply was: “He is well
enough as to health, but he is mighty
lonesome since the filly went away.”</p>

<p class='c008'>But of all the horses he ever owned,
Walk-in-the-Water was his especial favorite.
In the language of Burns, he
“lo’ed him like a vera brither.” He was
a large chestnut gelding, foaled in 1813,
by Sir Archie, dam by Gondola, a thoroughbred
son of Mark Anthony, and these
two were the only pure crosses in his
pedigree, yet he was distinguished on
the turf until fifteen years old, more especially
in races of three and four mile
heats.</p>

<p class='c008'>I was present when Walk, at nineteen
years of age, ran his last race, of four
mile heats, over the Nashville course,
against Polly Powell.</p>

<p class='c008'>Uncle Berry, several years before, had
presented him to Thomas Foxall, with a
positive agreement that he would neither
train nor run him again; having a
two-year-old in training, Mr. Foxall took
up the old horse merely to gallop in company
with him, a few weeks before the
Nashville meeting.</p>

<p class='c008'>It became well known that the mare
would start for the four mile purse, and
she was so great a favorite that no one
would enter against her.</p>

<p class='c008'>The proprietor, to prevent a “walkover,”
induced Foxall to allow him to
announce Walk-in-the-Water, whose name
would be sure to draw a crowd. There
was a large attendance, and the game old
horse made a wonderful race, considering
his age, running a heat and evidently
losing in consequence of his want of condition.
When the horses were brought
out I missed Uncle Berry, and went in
search of him. I found him in the grove
alone, sitting on a log and looking very
sad. “Are you not going up to see old
Walk run?” I inquired. “No, I would
as soon see a fight between my grandfather
and a boy of twenty,” he replied.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the year 1827, when Walk was fourteen
years old, Uncle Berry took him and
several colts that were entered in stakes
to Natchez, Miss., traveling by land
through the terrible swamps of the
Chickasaw and Choctaw Nations. The
colts had made very satisfactory trial
runs in Tennessee, but suffered so severely
from the journey that they either
paid forfeits or lost their stakes, so that
Walk-in-the-Water was the only hope for
winning expenses. He was entered in
the four mile race of the Jockey Club,
and his only competitor was the b.
gelding Archie Blucher, fifteen years old,
a horse of great fame as a “four miler”
in Mississippi.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the evening before the race the
Jockey Club met and changed the rule,
reducing the weight on all horses of fifteen
years or upward to one hundred
pounds, leaving all others their full
weight, or one hundred and twenty-four
pounds, three pounds less for mares and
geldings.</p>

<p class='c008'>This extraordinary proceeding would
not have been tolerated by the gentlemen
who, at a later day, composed that
Club, but Uncle Berry protested in vain
against the injustice done him. He, however,
concluded to run Walk, giving his
half brother twenty-one pounds advantage
in weight. Walk had the speed of Blucher,
and when the drum tapped, took the
track, with Blucher at his side, and these
two game Archies ran locked through
the heat, Walk winning by half a length.
The second heat was a repetition of the
first, and never was a more tremendous
struggle witnessed on a race course—a
blanket would have covered the horses
from the tap of the drum to the close of
the race.</p>

<p class='c008'>Any man who has watched a favorite
horse winning a race, out of the fire and
blue blazes at that, can appreciate Uncle
Berry’s feelings during that terrible
struggle. The horses swung into the
quarter stretch, the eighth and last mile,
and Uncle Berry, seeing the sorrel face
of his old favorite ahead, cried out at
the top of his voice, “Come home, Walk,
come home! Your master wants money,
and that badly.” After the race he expressed
his opinion of the Club in no
measured terms. Though habitually polite
and respectful, particularly toward
the authorities of a Jockey Club, he was
a man of undaunted courage and ready
to resist oppression, irrespective of consequences,
but his friends interposed and
persuaded him to let the matter pass.</p>

<p class='c008'>When he reached the stables the
horses were being prepared for their
night’s rest, and he made them each an
address. “Jo,” he said to a Pacolet colt,
named Jo Doan, that had lost his stake
in slow time, “you won’t do to tie to;
I’ve always done a good part by you. I
salted you out of my hand while you
sucked your mammy; you know what
you promised me before you left home
(alluding to a trial run), and now you
have thrown me off among strangers,”
and he passed on, complaining of the
other colts. The groom was washing
old Walk-in-the-Water’s legs while he
stood calm and majestic, with his game,
intelligent head, large, brilliant eyes, inclined
shoulders and immense windpipe,
looking every inch a hero. When Uncle
Berry came to him he threw his arms
around his neck and said, bursting into
tears, “Here’s a poor old man’s friend in
a distant land.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Walk-in-the-Water won more long races
than any horse of his day. If I can procure
the early volumes of the American
Turf Register, I will in a future number
give some account of his performances.</p>

<p class='c008'>Haney’s Maria was a most extraordinary
race nag at all distances, probably
not inferior to any which has appeared
in America since her day. She was bred
by Bennet Goodrum, of Virginia, who
moved to North Carolina, where she was
foaled in the spring of 1808; from there
he removed to Tennessee, and, in the fall
of 1809, sold Maria to Capt. Jesse Haney,
of Sumner County. She was by imported
Diomed, one of the last of his get when
thirty years of age. Her first dam was
by Taylor’s Bel-Air (the best son of imported
Medley), second dam by Symmes’
Wild Air, third dam by imported Othello,
out of an imported mare.</p>

<p class='c008'>She was a dark chestnut, exactly fifteen
hands high, possessing great
strength, muscular power, and symmetry,
the perfect model of a race horse. Maria
commenced her turf career at three, and
ran all distances from a quarter of a
mile to four mile heats, without losing
a race or heat until she was nine years
old. In the fall of 1811 she ran a sweepstake
over the Nashville course, entrance
$100, two mile heats, beating General
Jackson’s colt, Decatur, by Truxton;
Col. Robert Bell’s filly, by imported
Diomed, and four others; all distanced
the first heat, except Bell’s filly. This
defeat aroused the fire and combative
spirit of General Jackson almost as much
as did his defeat by Mr. Adams for the
Presidency, and he swore “by the Eternal”
he would beat her if a horse could
be found in the United States able to
do so. But, although the General conquered
the Indians, defeated Packenham,
beat Adams and Clay, crushed the monster
bank under the heel of his military
boot, he could not beat Maria, in the
hands of Uncle Berry.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the fall of 1812, over the same
course, she won a sweepstake, $500 entrance,
four mile heats, beating Colonel
Bell’s Diomed mare, a horse called Clifden,
and Col. Ed Bradley’s “Dungannon.”
(General Jackson was interested
in Dungannon.) This was a most exciting
and interesting race, especially to
the ladies, who attended in great numbers;
those of Davidson County, with
Aunt Rachel Jackson and her niece, Miss
Rachel Hays, at their head, backing
Dungannon, while the Sumner County ladies,
led by Miss Clarissa Bledsoe, daughter
of the pioneer hero, Col. Anthony
Bledsoe, bet their last glove on little
Maria. After this second defeat, General
Jackson became terribly in earnest, and
before he gave up the effort to beat
Maria, he ransacked Virginia, South Carolina,
Georgia and Kentucky. He was
almost as clamorous for a horse as was
Richard in the battle of Bosworth Field.
He first wrote Col. William R. Johnson
to send him the best four mile horse
in Virginia, without regard to price, expressing
a preference for the famous Bel-Air
mare, Old Favorite. Colonel Johnson
sent him, at a high price, the celebrated
horse, Pacolet, by imported Citizen,
who had greatly distinguished himself
as a four miler in Virginia. In the
fall of 1813, at Nashville, Maria won a
sweepstake, $1,000 entrance, $500 forfeit,
four mile heats, beating Pacolet with
great ease, two paying forfeit. It was
said that Pacolet had received an injury
in one of his fore ankles. The General,
being anything but satisfied with
the result, made a match on Pacolet
against Maria for $1,000 a side, $500 forfeit,
four mile heats, to come off over
the same course, the fall of 1814; but,
Pacolet being still lame, he paid forfeit.
These repeated failures only made the
General more inflexible in his purpose,
and, in conjunction with Mr. James Jackson,
who then resided in the vicinity of
Nashville, he sent to South Carolina and
bought Tam O’Shanter, a horse distinguished
in that state.</p>

<p class='c008'>The fall of 1814 Maria won, over the
same course, club purse of $275, two
mile heats, beating Tam O’Shanter, William
Lytle’s Royalist, and two or three
others.</p>

<p class='c008'>A few days after, over the same course,
she won a proprietor’s purse, $350, only
one starting against her. About this
time General Jackson sent to Georgia and
purchased of Colonel Alston Stump-the-Dealer,
but, for some cause, did not match
him against Maria. The General then
sent to Kentucky and induced Mr. DeWett
to come to the Hermitage with his
mare (reputed to be the swiftest mile
nag in the United States), with a view
of matching her against Maria. Mr.
DeWett trained his mare at the Hermitage.
In the fall of 1814, at Clover Bottom,
Maria beat this mare for $1,000 a
side, dash of a mile. In the fall of 1815
General Jackson and Mr. DeWett ran the
same mare against Maria, dash of half a
mile, for $1,500 a side, $500 on the first
quarter, $500 on six hundred yards, and
$500 on the half mile, all of which bets
were won by Maria, the last by one hundred
feet. This was run at Nashville.
The next week, over same course, she
won a match $1,000 a side, mile heats,
made with General Jackson and Col.
Ed Ward, beating the Colonel’s horse,
Western Light. Soon after this race she
was again matched against her old competitor,
DeWett’s mare, for $1,000 a side,
over the same course (which was in McNairy’s
Bottom, above the sulphur
spring), Maria giving her a distance
(which was then 120 yards) in a dash
of two miles. Colonel Lynch, of Virginia,
had been induced to come and bring his
famous colored rider, Dick, to ride DeWett’s
mare. Before the last start Uncle
Berry directed his rider (also colored)
to put the spurs to Maria from the tap of
the drum. But, to his amazement, they
went off at a moderate gait, DeWett’s
mare in the lead, making the first mile
in exactly two minutes. As they passed
the stand Uncle Berry ordered his boy to
go on, but the mares continued at the
same rate until after they entered the
back stretch, Maria still a little in the
rear, when the rider gave her the spurs
and she beat her competitor one hundred
and eighty yards, making the last mile
in one minute and forty-eight seconds.
All who saw the race declared that she
made the most extraordinary display of
speed they ever witnessed.</p>

<p class='c008'>When Uncle Berry demanded an explanation
of his rider he learned that
Dick, who professed to be a conjurer, or
spiritualist, had frightened the boy by
threatening that if he attempted to pass
ahead of him until they ran a mile and
a quarter, he would lift him out of his
saddle, or throw down his mare by a
mere motion of his whip, which the boy
fully believed. Most negroes at that time,
and some white people in this enlightened
age, believe in these absurdities.
The speed of Maria was wonderful. She
and the famous quarter race horse, Saltram,
were trained by Uncle Berry at the
same time, and he often “brushed” them
through the quarter stretch, “and they
always came out locked.” Whichever
one got the start kept the lead.</p>

<p class='c008'>After the last race above mentioned,
some Virginians present said that there
were horses in Virginia that could beat
Maria. Captain Haney offered to match
her against any horse in the world, from
one to four mile heats, for $5,000.</p>

<p class='c008'>Shortly after this conversation, meeting
General Jackson, Captain Haney informed
him what had passed, and the
General, in his impressive manner, replied:
“Make the race for $50,000, and
consider me in with you. She can beat
any animal in God’s whole creation.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In March, 1816, at Lexington, Ky., she
beat Robin Gray (sire of Lexington’s
third dam) a match, mile heats, for $1,000
a side. The next month she beat at
Cage’s race paths in Sumner County, near
Bender’s Ferry, Mr. John Childress’
Woodlawn filly, by Truxton, a straight
half mile for $1,000 a side, giving her
sixty feet. Maria won this race by two
feet only. This was the first race I ever
saw, and I was greatly impressed with
the beautiful riding of Monkey Simon.</p>

<p class='c008'>After the race Maria was taken by
Uncle Berry to Waynesboro, Ga., where
she bantered the world, but could not
get a race. There were very few jockey
clubs in the country at that time.</p>

<p class='c008'>In January, 1817, Maria was returned
to Captain Haney in Sumner County, and
soon afterwards sold by him to Pollard
Brown, who got her beaten at Charleston
in a four mile heat race with Transport
and Little John, when she was nine years
old. Maria carried over weight, ran
under many disadvantages, and lost the
race by only a few feet.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>We will venture the assertion that
when the history of the past century
is being written up, the chroniclers
will discover that there has been
as much, if not more progress and advancement
made in the nineteenth century
than in all of the eighteen centuries
preceding it. The advancement in the
past century was phenomenal in the marvelous
achievements in inventions and
in discoveries in every branch of industry,
in the arts and sciences; and I am
delighted to know that agriculture, horticulture
and floriculture have also received
some attention, although not so much as
might have been. Still, we are pleased
that a beginning in those branches has
been made, and we hope for much more
rapid advancement within the next two
decades.</p>

<p class='c008'>That there has been a great awakening
and a marked advancement in the
material progress in the past century no
one will seek to controvert the fact, but
let us hope that while we have been making
such rapid strides materially we
have also, during the same period,
made equally as much advancement spiritually,
for to glorify God is (or ought
to be) man’s chief aim in life. There
has been a beginning in the advancement
of scientific agriculture, and
the agricultural world is indebted to no
one so much as to John Bennett Lawes,
of Rothamsted, England, who devoted a
lifetime of study and the lands of his
large estate to experimental farming, the
results of which he published from time
to time in the Gardener’s Chronicle, and
at his death left a fund sufficient in trust
to carry on the great work he had begun
and carried forward his celebrated
tests of experimental farming, extending
over fifty years, from 1844 to 1893. Indeed,
John Bennett Lawes may justly be
called the father of the experimental stations
in our country. In these earliest experiments
the effects of various manures
were carried out. It was in these trials
that the excellent results obtained by
manuring turnips with phosphate previously
treated with sulphuric acid were
first discovered, and his taking out a
patent, in 1842, for treating mineral phosphate
with sulphuric acid, which was
the commencement of the present enormous
manufacture of artificial manures.
The above experiments were carried on
in pots by Mr. Lawes, but, in 1843, he
was joined by Dr. Gilbert, as eminent a
chemist as was Mr. Lawes himself, and
from 1844 began the field experiments,
which have become world-wide for the
great benefits they have resulted in to
agriculturists everywhere.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Rothamsted estate was divided
into small fields, and the effects of the
various crops on the fields with and
without manure were carefully noted.
Soils were analyzed before the crops were
planted, and also after the crops were
harvested, to determine the loss or gain
of nitrogen.</p>

<p class='c008'>The rotation of crops was studied thoroughly,
and beans and peas were then
made one in a four-course rotation. But
even earlier than 1844 it had been observed
that leguminous plants, of which
there are thousands distributed over
this sphere, had a beneficial effect
on the land for the succeeding crop.
At Rothamsted the legumes, or such of
them as beans, peas or red clover, were
thoroughly tried, and it was invariably
found as one in a rotation of four to
produce the same results. In some
way that they then could not explain, the
land after a crop of legumes was very
much richer in nitrogen, amounting in
many instances to 300 pounds per acre.
These worthy gentlemen kept on for
years trying to account for the phenomenon
and endeavored to discover the true
source of nitrification. But to the French
chemists Schlosing and Muntz belong
the credit of establishing by experiment
the true nature of nitrification. Their
first paper on the subject appeared early
in 1877, or only twenty-nine years ago.
They wished to ascertain if the presence
of humic matter was essential to the purification
of sewage by soil, and for this
purpose they conducted an experiment,
in which sewage was passed slowly
through a column of sand and limestone.
Under these circumstances complete nitrification
of the sewage took place. They
then allowed a chloroform vapor to fall
for some time on top of the column, the
sewage passing as before. Nitrification
now entirely ceased and was not renewed
for seven weeks, though the supply of
chloroform was suspended. A small
quantity of nitrifying soil was shaken
with the water and the turbid extracts
poured on the top of the column. Nitrification
at once recommenced, as strongly
as before.</p>

<p class='c008'>To appreciate the force of the experiment,
Muntz had previously shown that
chloroform was a means of distinguishing
between the action of a simple ferment
as diastase, and a living organism, as
yeast, the chloroform having no influence
on the work of the unorganized ferment,
which immediately stopped the activity
of a living agent. The above discovery
of Schlosing and Muntz of the true theory
of nitrification of the soil was the greatest
achievement to the agricultural world,
inasmuch as it has been demonstrated
by numerous eminent chemists and
proved to be an ascertained fact; and this
problem solved, which had occupied the
ablest scientific minds for centuries. Now
we hope for some advancement with the
farmers of the United States in the
future. With the discovery of Schlosing
and Muntz there is no necessity for such
an idea as wornout land, as is prevalent
in this great country, where the chief
occupation of the agriculturist has been
in exploiting his land, just in the same
manner as everything else has been exploited.
With an ever increasing population
of this sphere, there is no need
to fear the earth’s capacity in producing
enough to supply all their wants. That
is when our farmers realize the paramount
importance of the above discovery,
and begin to see how bountifully an all-wise
Creator has provided for us in placing
these legumes on this earth for the
benefit of mankind. They are a double
blessing to us, for they not only abstract
nitrogen from the atmosphere and deposit
it in the ground for the succeeding crops,
and restore the fertility of the land, but
also, when they are made one in a four-course
rotation, fill the soil with fibre
or roots, which no soil can be in its highest
productive condition without.</p>

  <h2 id='SOUTH' class='c005'>The Great New South</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In the past quarter of a century (1880–1905)
from statistics gathered by Richard
H. Edmonds, Trotwood’s finds the South has
doubled the value of her cotton crop, her
exports and her assessed property; has trebled
her manufacturing products, her railroad
mileage and the value of her farm products.
She has multiplied by five her lumber products,
increased her manufacturing capital
six-fold, her tons of pig iron produced eight-fold,
her phosphate tons mined nine-fold, her
cotton bales consumed ten-fold, her capital
invested in cotton mills eleven-fold, her tons
of coal mined twelve-fold, her number of
spindles on cotton mills fourteen-fold, her
tons of coke produced sixteen-fold, her number
of cotton oil mills seventeen-fold, her
capital invested in cotton oil mills eighteen-fold,
and her barrels of petroleum two hundred
and thirty-five-fold!</p>

<p class='c008'>She raised three-fourths of the world’s
cotton, and has one-half of the standing
timber of the whole country. Her own cotton
mills consume 2,282,900 bales yearly, or
nearly as much as New England and all the
rest of the country combined, whereas in
1880 she consumed but one-sixth as much as
New England. Europe pays her a tribute
of over <i>one million dollars daily for cotton</i>.
Thus marches on the Great New South.</p>

he was building a pen to put the fattening
Berkshires in. For a month these
slick rascals had been running in the
ten-acre lot planted in corn and, at the
“lay-by plowing,” sown in peas, all for
their especial benefit. The corn had
nearly ripened and the peas were in the
pod; and now, day after day they had
wallowed in the water of the ten-acre

corn stalks or eaten the juicy peas till

<p class='c008'>“Now, Unk Pete an’ me, suh,” he explained,
“belong to de same church—de
Candle Light—an’ to de same lodge—de
Ainshunt an’ Honorbul Order ob
de Bow-legged Sons of de Black Cat—an’
’course I ain’ gwi’ marry his widder
now an’ spile sum moral observashun,
so I jes’ stopped at his cabin to git his
consent fur me to marry his widder.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Get his consent?” I asked. “Why
how could you get his consent if he
was dead?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Who sed he was dead?” said the old
darky, quickly. “I nurver sed so; I sed
she was his widder!”</p>

<p class='c008'>I tried to explain to him that a man
couldn’t have a widow unless he were
dead, but this only made him throw
back his head and laugh heartily.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Wal, wal, wal, white folks got such
curious ways of thinkin’. Who’d urver
thout it? You see,” he said very solemnly
and impressively, “It was dis
way: Unk Peter wus gittin’ ole, an’
went off contrawise to de doctrine an’
marrid dis young ’oman. Furst thing
he know, he waked up sum mohnin’ an’
find hisself de father ob ten chilouns,
sum ob ’em hisn an’ sum ob ’em hern,
by her fus’ husban’, an’ dar he wus
gittin’ so ole he cudn’t s’port ’em. So
up he jumps an’ at de naixt meetin’ ob
de church he runs fer de offis ob Patriark
ob Santerfercashun, which, ’kordin’
to de doctrine ob Hollerness, marrid ’im
to de church. ’Course arter Unk Pete
gits santerfercashun an’ marrid to de

so he hafter put Sis Calline an’ de chilluns
aside, which made all ob dem de
widders ob de church. Don’t you ketch
on to de doctrine, suh?”</p>

<p class='c008'>I told him I had caught.</p>

<p class='c008'>The old man was silent as if in deep
thought. Then he said: “I wus young
den, an’ bleeved eberything erbout de
church an’ de doctrine I eber heurd,
smelt or dreamed, but I am older now,
an’ I’ve cum to de pinted konklushun

<p class='c008'>“Brer Peter wus in deep prayer when
I rid up to his cabin, an’ arter he ris

<p class='c008'>“I tell you, suh, Brer Peter tuck

didn’t wanter do dat thing ’tall. But
arter he dun prayed ober it, he cum out
wid er new light in his eye, an’ he put

And he kinder wink his off eye an’ sed,

<p class='c008'>“But when I got to de widder’s cabin

<p class='c008'>“‘Brer Washington,’ she sez, ‘dis am

you’d be satisfied ef I’d continue in de
sisterly relashuns ob de church wid

<p class='c008'>“‘Sister Calline,’ sez I, sorter detarmined
lak, ‘I’ve had ten ebry day sisters

<p class='c008'>“Oh, I tell you, suh, you gotter shoot

<p class='c008'>“We kept it up for hours, she argyfyin’

“Thou shalt not afflict any widder or

Timerthy, de fifth chapter an’ de third
verse, an’ sez I, ‘Sister Calline, whut
you read am Ole Testament. It am
anshunt histery. Heah am de New Testament,
heah am de new doctrine:

Oh, I tell you, Boss,” laughed

<p class='c008'>“But goodness grashus!” he said, as
if suddenly remembering something.
“I’d better be buildin’ dis pen or we
won’t hab enny sawseges fur Kristmus,”
and he began to saw energetically.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hold on,” I said, “You never told me
whether you married the widow or not.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He looked at me in undisguised astonishment—“Law,
law, law,” he said,
“white folks got such curis ideas. In
course I did—marrid her dat night an’
tuck ’er home de naixt day; ain’t I bin
tellin’ you whut er hard time I had
gettin’ konsolashun frum dat ar ’oman?”</p>

<p class='c008'>He sawed vigorously away for awhile,
but I could see he wished to tell something
else. Finally I said:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, go on, I’m waiting.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He turned around quickly, laid down
his saw, laughed, and said: “How de
wurl did you know dar was ennything
else? Bless my life, suh, but de very
look ob er white man am er search warrant
to de nigger’s soul. Ef you bleegter

slyly around: “I hadn’t been married
to dat ’oman but two years befo’ I had
to run fur er offis, too.</p>

<p class='c008'>“What office?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>He grinned sheepishly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Patriark ob de Santerfercashun,” he
said, “I beat Unk Peter fur dat offis, an’
got eben wid ’im at his own game.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Lemme tell you, chile,” he added,
impressively, “two years ob konsolashun

and he resumed his sawing with a vigor.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>He was a fine-looking old gentleman,
well-dressed and had the air of
a well-to-do business man. A silver-white
mustache set off his cheery-looking,
full, round face, and something in
his eyes told me he wasn’t at all struck
on formality and would not mind talking
to a stranger, to pass
away an hour or two in
a sleeping-car.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>An Unfinished Race.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
I noticed,
too, that his left
sleeve had no arm in it, and then that
he had on a G. A. R. button.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That old fellow is all right,” I said
to myself, “and I’ll bet he left that arm
down in Tennessee. There are a dozen
good yarns tucked away under that derby
hat that have never yet seen the color
of white paper, and I am going to get
one of them. I should say that he
fought from Shiloh to Chickamauga and
from Chattanooga to Nashville, and made
a good one, too, or else he wouldn’t have
left that arm in the enemy’s country.”
“He fought the war out,” I said, after I
had studied his countenance more closely
and noticed the big bump of benignity
that made up his back head and ended in
kind, mild countenance; “and after it
was over he let it stay over, forgot all
its meanness, inhumanity and cussedness
generally, came on up here to Indiana
and went into business, attended strictly
to it, and is now a well-to-do business
man.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Satisfied that my diagnosis was correct,
I went over, and taking a seat by
him, began to slyly get in my net for
the fish I knew was there.</p>

<p class='c008'>“From Middle Tennessee, you say?” he
said after awhile. “Well, I guess I know
every foot of it, nearly.” He laughed.
“Under a little black locust tree near
Murfreesboro is what is left of this,”
he said, as he touched his empty coat
sleeve. “I have often wanted to go back
there and see some of those pretty farms
and good horses and bluegrass hills when
I didn’t have any guard duty to do and
wasn’t looking for an enemy, but
friends.”</p>

<p class='c008'>I cordially invited him to come, and
mentioned how many of the veterans
come down every now and then to go
over the battlefields of the South.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Is that long, wooden, covered bridge
still spanning Duck River at Columbia?”
he asked quickly, as if suddenly remembering
all about it. “That old bridge
has got a history,” he continued. “I was
with Buell when we got orders that we
were to unite our army with Grant’s
somewhere in the neighborhood of Pittsburg
Landing, on the Tennessee. When
we reached Columbia the river was up
and the bridge was partially destroyed,
and all the flooring burned. I was one
of the engineers and had to repair the
bridge. Word had come that we were
needed badly, and we worked day and
night. Then word came that we were
needed worse, and by hard dint I got
the army over, and on we rushed for
Pittsburg Landing. We got there almost
too late. Grant’s army was nearly
ruined. Johnston had driven it from
Shiloh Church to the river bank, a distance
of five or six miles, and only
our arrival that night, bringing in the
thirty or thirty-five thousand of Buell’s
army, saved Grant. On what small
things do great destinies hang!” he
mused. “A loss of a day at Columbia
would have changed the history of this
country, and General Grant, instead of
having been President, would have been
one more of our unsuccessful generals.</p>

<p class='c008'>“But the funniest experience I had in
Tennessee was at a little place in Marshall
County, almost at the extreme edge
of our army’s position. It was after the
battle of Shiloh, when the main army
was at Nashville and our outposts went
as far south as Pulaski. Do you all still
raise pacing horses down there?”</p>

<p class='c008'>I looked around to see if anybody was
near enough to understand the humor of
such a question, but seeing none, and no
sign of a joke on the old gentleman’s
face, I kept my face straight as I answered
him that we still raised a few.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I was always fond of a good saddle
horse,” he went on, “and many of the
boys in our company of cavalry were of
the same way of thinking. In fact, we
had picked up a whole company of them
down there, and I’m afraid we did not
take the trouble to issue any Government
warrants for them either,” he
laughed. “So when we went into camp
in this village of Marshall County we
had a company of as fine horses as any
cavalry company ever bestrode. Time
went a little heavy on our hands, until
one day some of the boys got up a bet
on the speed of their respective horses,
and a quarter race was run that evening
at which the entire company turned out.
It was won by a little roan horse that
could pace nearly as fast as he could
run, which was saying a good deal, for
he could run for a quarter of a mile
about as fast as anything I ever saw on
four legs. Well, he won, and two days
afterward beat two others, and a week
after that beat everything they could
rake and scrape up against him. All
this was hugely interesting and immensely
exciting, and as none of us had
ever heard anything of the presence of
the rebel cavalry leader and reckless
raider, General Forrest, and never dreamed
of the danger we were in, I am sorry
to say that we were more interested in
horse-racing just then than anything else.
The owner of the horse called the
little roan pacer and runner “Mack,” in
honor of General MacPherson, who commanded
some of us at Shiloh. Well,
after Mack had beaten everything running,
it was announced in camp one day
that Mack’s match at pacing had been
captured a few days before, and a big
pacing race was to come off that evening
to decide it. I had never seen a pacing
race under saddle, and with all the
others I went out to see it. You can
imagine what asses we were when we
left everything in camp, even our side
arms, in care of a few sentinels and
camp followers, and all of us adjourned
to an old field about a quarter of a mile
to see the sport. The track was a half-mile,
laid off on a nice country road,
the judges standing at the end of the
half mile and the start was at the beginning.
It is needless to say that every
man in the company was at the end
of the track where the judges were. The
horses were nearly equal favorites, and
we soon had to appoint a man to hold the
bets. He had his hands full, for every
man in the company had something upon
the race, and the goose hung high—and
we were the goose,” he laughed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“There were to be three heats. An
Indiana man rode Mack, and an Ohio
man rode the other horse. Down the
lane they came on the first heat, and
all of us strained our necks to see who
led. In forty yards of the wire, so to
speak, Mack lost his head, concluded he
was born for running and not for pacing,
broke out and ran away from his man.
The judges gave the heat to the other
horse. This made Mack’s friends mad,
and after a good deal of palavering the
heat was declared off and everything
started over. In this heat Mack got
down to business and beat the other
horse by the nose. But in the next heat
the other horse turned the tables on
Mack and beat him a good length. I’ve
seen a good many harness races in my
day since then,” continued the old soldier,
“but I never saw one that interested
me as much as that. Everything was
excitement, and the boys were betting
everything they had, from hardtacks to
dollars. When they turned up the road
to come down for the third heat, we
could easily see them from where we
were, as the beginning of the track was
slightly elevated. They turned ’round
to come, when all at once I saw both
horses stop, their riders looking intently
toward the camp, which was behind us
and could be seen by them from their
slight elevation. In another instant they
started, but not our way. They gave one
wild shout, bolted the fence on the side
of the road and lit out across the fields,
according to our notion, like two fools.
Before we had time to imagine what
was up, we heard some shouts and shots
in camp, some wild galloping and yells
our way, and we turned ’round only to
rush into the arms of a detachment, some
five-hundred strong, of Forrest’s Cavalry.
If there ever were a cheap set, we were
the boys. We made no bones of surrendering,
for we hadn’t a dog’s show
and were glad to get off with our clothes.</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘What in h—— are you Yanks doin’
down here, anyway?’ asked their leader,
a big fellow with a Colonel’s gray uniform
on. When the situation was explained
to him he laughed like a big
schoolboy. ‘Where is the stakeholder?’
he asked. When this gentleman was
pointed out he hollered out: ‘Fetch them
stakes over here, sonny, and tell the
judges all bets are declared off on this
race’! And the way the Johnnies laughed
racked us more than being captured.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We soon learned the secret of the
thing. Forrest had made one of his
characteristic raids around Nashville,
captured and burned our stores at Gallatin
and Murfreesboro, and was sweeping
on towards Bragg’s army at Tullahoma.
In his sweep he simply scooped us up
while we were down in the woods of Marshall
County, running a pumpkin fair, a
goose show and a pacing meeting. But
he was in a big hurry himself, for nearly
all of Buell’s cavalry were after him. He
had no time to do anything but take
all we had, including our horses, the
gate receipts and the book money and
parole us and push on. But he never
got Mack and the other horse, and to
this day I have always wished that he
had waited five minutes longer. I’d give
ten dollars now,” he added, “to know
whether Mack or the other horse would
have won that last heat. But we never
knew, for we were soon forced to the
front again; forgot all about our paroles,
for we never did think we were fairly
captured, and I never saw Mack or his
rider again. I stayed the war out, but
I never went to see any more pacing
races in the enemy’s country,” he
laughed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Well, come down this fall and see
some in the country of friends,” I said.
We shook hands and parted.</p>

<hr class='c016' />
<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c019'>The poem below goes the rounds of
the press every year signed with
the name of Gen. Albert Pike. In
fact, such is the general belief,
and all the books in which I have seen
this poem printed fall into this
error.
<span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>The Old Canoe.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
But though General
Pike wrote some very beautiful
poems, he did not write
this one. We have his own admission
made to Senator Carmack, the distinguished
senior Senator from Tennessee.
Like many other good poems, it was,
perhaps, the only one some poet wrote,
and, never thinking it would be immortal,
or that it had any special merit,
failed to sign his name to it.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is a little curious how this poem
became identified with General Pike. But
we learn how it was from an old citizen
of Columbia, Tenn., who knew General
Pike when he was a young man and lived
here. Pike practiced law there when he
first started out in life, but met with
poor success. Becoming despondent, he
one night paid his hotel bill, went to
the river’s edge, got into an old canoe,
and drifted down to Williamsport, where
he took the stage for Nashville. From
there he went West, where he became
a successful lawyer and politician, and
afterwards wrote a volume of poetry.
Those poems in which he allowed himself
to be natural, such as “Every Year”
and others, are very beautiful. But in
his most pretentious poem he seems to
imitate Keats and Shelley, and so lost
his own individuality.</p>

<p class='c008'>After many years Pike came back to
Columbia, a celebrated man. He was an
ardent Whig, and made a big speech in
support of his principles. To offset his
influence some ardent Democrat composed
a doggerel called “The Old Canoe,”
in which it was plainly intimated that
Pike had left here years before between
two suns, and had not been too particular
about taking some one else’s canoe to
get away in. This doggerel was sung
around the streets until General Pike and
his friends were exasperated beyond
measure, ending in the sensitive poet’s
leaving the town. Of course, it was all
a lie, and the old canoe was probably
the property of no man, but it seems that
then, as now, nothing was too mean for
one political party to say of another.
This beautiful poem, “The Old Canoe,”
coming out about that time, was attributed
to General Pike, and its authorship
has never before, perhaps, been publicly
corrected. It is found in the schoolbooks,
and in books on elocution, as being by
General Pike, but Senator Carmack is
our authority that General Pike himself
told him he did not write it.</p>

      <div class='line'>And crossed on the railing one o’er one</div>
      <div class='line'>Like the folded hands when the work is done.</div>
      <div class='line'>While busily back and forth between</div>
      <div class='line'>The spider stretches his silvery sheen</div>
      <div class='line'>And the solemn owl, with his dull “too-hoo”</div>
      <div class='line'>Settles down on the side of the old canoe.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The stern half-sunk in the slimy wave</div>
      <div class='line'>Rots slowly away in its living grave,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the green moss creeps o’er its dull decay,</div>
      <div class='line'>Hiding its moldering dust away.</div>
      <div class='line'>Like the hand that plants o’er the tomb a flower</div>
      <div class='line'>Or the ivy that mantles the falling tower;</div>
      <div class='line'>While many a blossom of loveliest hue</div>
      <div class='line'>Springs up o’er the stern of the old canoe.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>The current-less waters are dead and still,</div>
      <div class='line'>But the light wind plays with the boat at will;</div>
      <div class='line'>And lazily in and out again</div>
      <div class='line'>It floats the length of the rusty chain.</div>
      <div class='line'>Like the weary march of the hands of time,</div>
      <div class='line'>That meet and part at the noontide chime;</div>
      <div class='line'>And the shore is kissed at each turning anew,</div>
      <div class='line'>By the dripping bow of the old canoe.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Oh, many a time, with a careless hand,</div>
      <div class='line'>I have pushed it away from the pebbly strand,</div>
      <div class='line'>And paddled it down where the stream runs quick,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where the whirls are wild and the eddies are thick,</div>
      <div class='line'>And laughed as I leaned o’er the rocking side,</div>
      <div class='line'>And looked below in the broken tide,</div>
      <div class='line'>To see that the faces and boats were two,</div>
      <div class='line'>That were mirrored back from the old canoe.</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>But now, as I lean o’er the crumbling side,</div>
      <div class='line'>And look below in the sluggish tide,</div>
      <div class='line'>The face that I see there is graver grown,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the laugh that I hear has a soberer tone,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the hands that lent to the light skiff wings</div>
      <div class='line'>Have grown familiar with sterner things.</div>
      <div class='line'>But I love to think of the hours that sped</div>
      <div class='line'>As I rocked where the whirls their white spray shed,</div>
      <div class='line'>Ere the blossoms waved, or the green grass grew</div>
      <div class='line'>O’er the moldering stern of the old canoe.</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c019'>The mule is such an ungainly animal
that very few ladies are given
over to admiring him. As for me, I’d
rather see an old mule coming my way
when I have the blues, than to see a
long absent friend.</p>

<div class='sidenote'>A Mule and a Proposal.</div>

<p class='c008'>I know that is a broad assertion, but
when you hear the why,
I know you will agree with
me, and say as did a little
negro, that “one end of
him was good.”</p>

<p class='c008'>When a little girl, I lived with my
people on a handsome farm three miles
distant to the church we attended.</p>

<p class='c008'>Charley, my dear lord and master,
lived only a mile from the church. You
see, Charley was the most bashful man
around the neighborhood, and while
everyone knew ages before he proposed,
that he loved me, it begun to look as
though he would never gather courage
enough to say so.</p>

<p class='c008'>Night after night he would call, and
invariably told me “I was looking kind
of pretty,” and after a dreadful silence,
he would break out suddenly, “I’m kind
o’ stuck on you,” giving me such a start
that I would nearly jump out of my chair.</p>

<p class='c008'>Beyond that “I’m kind o’ stuck on you,”
it seemed he would never get, and at last,
growing desperate, one night I determined
to use a little strategy and screw
his courage to the sticking point. So
when he came, and discoursed a short
time on the weather, the brightness of
the moon, our sick neighbors and such
like, I knew my time was near, and
awaited nervously for the never-failing
sentence, “I’m kind o’ stuck on you,”
when I expected to say, “Oh, Charles,
this is so sudden. I only thought you
liked me as a friend.” This I felt sure
would do the work.</p>

<p class='c008'>At last, clearing his throat, Charles
made ready. Looking lovingly at me, he
said, “May, I’m kind o’ stuck on you,”
and before the blush had fairly mantled
my cheeks, aye, before I had a chance to
utter a sound, the mean thing went on,
“Oh, May, I forgot to tell you, we have
a new colt.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Never in my life did I feel more like
strangling a man than I did that night.
I had to turn aside to hide my tears of
disappointment, for you must know that
I really loved the dear fellow. He was
not the least bit bashful with men, or
even in the presence of old women. But
when it came to girls, his conversation
above speaks volumes.</p>

<p class='c008'>One Sunday Charley had asked me if
I would allow him to drive me home
from church the following Sabbath. I
was only too willing to say yes, hoping
that something would happen to make
him utter the much-desired words. Oh,
girls, you can better imagine my disappointment
than I can describe it, when
late Saturday afternoon my mother’s
maiden sister arrived, bag and baggage.
I did not need to be told that I should
be left at home next morning, as the
carriage would not accommodate all.</p>

<p class='c008'>I could not eat any supper and later
brother Tom found me lying in my favorite
nook in the summer house, sobbing
as though my heart would break.</p>

<p class='c008'>Little by little he coaxed me into telling
him the reason for my grief, and at
last I told him of my promise to Charley.</p>

<p class='c008'>He sat and thought for a long time,
and then breaking out into a happy laugh,
he cried: “I have it, little Sis. When the
others are gone, I’ll saddle old Bob, and
you can ride behind me until we get near
the church, when we can get down and
tie Bob in the woods and walk the rest
of the way.”</p>

<p class='c008'>I felt many misgivings, I can tell you,
about riding that mule, but as this was
the only chance of getting to church, I
reluctantly assented. Accordingly, when
the carriage drove down the driveway
the next morning, I flew to my room
to dress, while Tom went out to saddle
Bob. We were soon ready, and with
Tom’s assistance I mounted behind him.
The first two miles were soon covered,
and feeling uncomfortable from the jolting
I was getting, I begged Tom to get
off and walk the rest of the way.</p>

<p class='c008'>All at once Tom uttered a yell like a
Comanche Indian, and never in the history
of the world did a mule make better
time than Bob did, getting nearer and
nearer to church at each leap.</p>

<p class='c008'>How I begged Tom to stop him and
let me get off. But never a whit did
Bob slacken his speed, and I thought I
would faint with horror as the church
appeared through the woods.</p>

<p class='c008'>Faster and faster we came right up
to the church door, and that mule brayed
longer and louder than he ever did
before.</p>

<p class='c008'>Down I slid, and back on the home
track I started as hard as I could run.
I had not gone far when a horse and
buggy came up behind me and a moment
later I was sobbing on Charley’s breast.</p>

<p class='c008'>He asked me to be his wife that day,
and I have long since forgiven the mule,
as he certainly brayed some courage into
my Charles. Can you blame me for
being an ardent admirer now of a mule?</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>No road is so typical of the Middle
Basin as that lying between Franklin
and Nashville. For ten miles it winds
around in the lowland basins or over the
intervening ridges, amid fields as fertile
as ever yielded their increase to the husbandman’s
plow. On each side the low
hill ranges lie, blue or brown, as the sun
happens to fall on them. Fertile to
their very tops are these hills, green in
grain or grasses, or darker green in
richer foliage. In this the Middle Basin,
through which for nearly a hundred miles
from Nashville to Pulaski, this historic
road runs, the country is different from
any in the South. Sea shells lie on the
tops of the hills—sea shells rich in lime
and phosphorus. Every foot of this
road is rich in history and tradition.
Down it rode Jackson, time and again,
from his home at The Hermitage, not
many miles away. Here, also, rode Polk
and Grundy and Sam Houston and
Crockett. An old man told me a story
about James K. Polk which I have never
seen in print. He said that in the memorable
campaign for the governorship
of Tennessee between James K. Polk
and Lean Jimmie Jones, in 1840 (in
which campaign it is said that Jones,
who was the greatest stump orator of
his day, and the father of that style
of oratory, almost drove the statesman
Polk from the hustings), there was
a mutual agreement between the candidates
that Polk should speak at Franklin
and Jones at Columbia, in the wind-up,
the day before the election. Columbia
was Polk’s home, and not very solid
for him at that. The friends of Polk
devised a scheme to give him the advantage
by making two speeches in a
day. So he made his speech early in
Franklin and had saddled and ready a
thoroughbred horse, which he mounted
after his speech, and galloped to Spring
Hill. There he took a fresh horse and
rode furiously to Columbia, arriving in
time to reply to Jones’ speech. But my
informant, who was an old line Whig,
informed me that though the future
President made record-breaking time
in his race down the pike, he lost in
votes when it became known that he
had broken his agreement and played
a trick on Lean Jimmie. Jones defeated
him for governor.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the greatest of all the history
made on this pike was made by the two
armies of Hood and Schofield, as they
swept over it in the early days of December,
1864, and then swept back
again. The situations were exactly reversed,
making a wave of war which
ebbed and flowed, carrying on its crest
the foam of wounds and death and woe.
Continuing the story from Hood’s invasion
from our last issue, Schofield’s
army reached Nashville after the battle
of Franklin, early in the morning of
December 1, 1864, and there united with
Thomas. Other detachments had been
called in, including Gen. A. J. Smith,
aggregating nearly 12,000 men, and later
Steedman, with 5,200 more. Milroy and
Granger, with 8,000 troops, were ordered
to Murfreesboro, and placed under the
command of General Rousseau. According
to General Cox (The March to the
Sea—Franklin and Nashville. Jacob D.
Cox, page 100), General Thomas had in
Nashville on the morning of November
30, 26,200 men. To these add Schofield’s
army of 34,000 men, and it will be seen
at a glance what Hood’s disheartened
and stricken army had to fight, and
Thomas, a Virginian, in command, with
the bulldog tenacity of Grant and the
courage of Hood.</p>

<p class='c008'>If Franklin had been desperate, what
could Hood do now, with the heart of
them dead in his brave men, with sorrow
in their hearts for comrades who
slept in trenches under the sod of
Franklin, and beloved commanders who,
now being dust, were but a week before
pictured forever between the sky and
the bastions of steel as they rode over
the breastworks to death? Even in the
heart of the starved and the hardened
lives memory—and what memory must
have been theirs in the sleet and cold
of those bitter December nights, while
waiting for Thomas to come forth from
his warmth and food to give battle.
If Franklin had been a desperate case,
was not this worse—the combined forces
of Thomas and Schofield, Smith and
Steedman? Anyone but Hood would
have stopped and thought, but Hood
never thought.</p>

<p class='c008'>“In truth,” says Cox, in the history
already quoted, “Hood’s situation was a
very difficult one, and to go forward or
to go back was almost equally unpromising.
He followed his natural bent, therefore,
which always favored the appearance,
at least, of aggression, and he
marched after Schofield to Nashville.”
Hood put Lee’s corps in the center
across the Franklin turnpike; Cheatham
took the right, and Stewart the left of
the line, while Forrest, with his cavalry,
occupied the country between Stewart
and the river below Nashville.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>General Van Dorn’s headquarters, near Spring Hill, where General Van Dorn was shot to death by one Dr. Peters for an alleged familiarity with the latter’s wife. Peters walked friendly into Van Dorn’s office, obtained a pass from the General to go through the line, shot him, jumped on a horse and escaped to the Federal line.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Here, from the first days of December
until the 15th, much of the time in sleet
and rain, Hood’s half starved veterans
awaited the oncoming of Thomas’ well
fed and well seasoned troops. Such a
meeting could scarcely be termed a battle,
however bravely the long, thin lines
might hold out, and however desperately
they might fight. Hood grimly made
two stands, but his gray lines, outflanked
and outfought, melted away into a disorganized
rush, back through mud and
slush and freezing rain to the Tennessee.
And now, back again, over the
same highway, rush the two armies.
Truly this historic highway was baptized
in blood. The weather was cold now,
sleeting. When it thawed there was
slush, and when it froze, needles of ice
for bare and bloody feet. No army since
Valley Forge suffered as did Hood’s
brave men. Truly, the men who could
follow Hood back to the Tennessee, in
the biting cold and hunger of those
days, in the numbness which knows that
all was lost, and the sorrow for those
who marched no more, truly, the stock
of that kind who fought it to a finish,
might well survive that their heroic
tribe might be given as a future pledge
for the perpetuity of the Republic.</p>

<p class='c008'>Two things alone saved Hood from
annihilation: The lack of real generalship
in his pursuers, who failed to push
their advantage to a finish, and the intrepid
genius of Forrest, who covered
Hood’s retreat. Had Johnston got
Sherman, had Lee got McClellan in
the fix Hood was now in, the map of
the Union would be painted to-day in
two colors.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of Forrest’s skill in saving Hood’s
army, General Cox pays tribute in the
following paragraph, when he says: “At
Columbia, Forrest rejoined Hood, and
his cavalry, with an infantry rear guard,
under command of General Walthall,
covered the retreat to the Tennessee....
This  force was able to
present so strong a front that&nbsp;...
our advance guard was not able to
break through.” But the freezing,
pitiless retreat of a brave, broken
army, who had gone into this Pike
of Battles fit to fight for a kingdom,
who had done more than any similar
body of men had ever done before, in
facing snow and sleet and hunger and
bastions of steel and the entrenched
thousands of a well-fed city’s troops, and
now went out under the fatal inefficiency
of him who led them, is one of the great
tragic stories of the Lost Cause.</p>

<p class='c008'>Forever will this historic highway run
between sloping hills and sinking valleys,
from the Basin’s Rim to the Tennessee;
forever will it girdle with protecting
arms the swelling glories of its maiden
hills. The sentinel rows of corn land,
the massed squadrons of wheat, forever
will follow the line of its march, helmeted
in tassle-caps, sheathed in scabbard
sheafs, with meshes of gold and
gilt, while from the forts of its over-towering
hills orchards of apples will
drop their balls of gold where once contending
cannon hurled theirs of steel.
Forever and forever, a tribute and a lesson
to all time that brother no more
shall kill brother in the dawning glory of
a new age and a new Union. But never
again will it see the equal of that desperate
courage, that sacrifice for conscience,
that valor for home and country
as each saw it, as shown by these
two armies which swept north and south
in glory and in gloom.</p>

<p class='c008'>Trotwood does not like to end anything
in gloom and sorrow, and so will
end this sketch of this historical highway
with some cavalry yarns he has
picked up from the old survivors of this
and other battles.</p>

<p class='c008'>Several years ago, at a Confederate
reunion, he found himself among a group
of interesting talkers—men who had
been makers of history in this great
struggle. All of them have now joined
their comrades who had gone before—and
right worthily they went, as their
life’s record will show. Among that
number was Gen. W. H. Jackson, the
owner of Belle Meade, then the
most famous thoroughbred nursery in
America. <span class='sni'><span class='hidev'>|</span>Some Cavalry Yarns.<span class='hidev'>|</span></span>
On his left was the State’s
chief executive, Governor
Turney, or “Old
Pete,” as the big brained
and big framed fellow
under the slouch hat was familiarly
called by every schoolboy in the
State. Other congenial spirits were
around, high in social and political circles,
drawn by the annual reunion of
Confederate veterans. Some war yarns
had passed around and General Jackson,
who was a brilliant cavalry leader himself,
was explaining how efficient the
cavalry service was. The General himself
fought through the war and thought
that the best horses in the world for
cavalry purposes were those with a good
dash of thoroughbred in them. Jackson
himself rode thoroughbreds all through
the war. So did Fitz-Hugh Lee, of Virginia;
John H. Morgan, the famous
raider, and many others.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I remember the time I longed for
one mighty bad,” quietly remarked an
Alabama colonel present, as he knocked
the ashes off his cigar and smiled at
the turn the story was taking. “It was
around Vicksburg, in the trenches, and
Grant was crowding us day and night.
We lived on raw beef and such dogs as
happened to stray out of the city, and
were begrimed, dirty, half starved and
homesick. Right next to us in the
trenches was a Tennessee company,
whose captain always managed to ride
around on a black thoroughbred horse,
as handsome a creature as you ever saw,
and which he kept slick and fat and curried
always—though the Lord only
knows where he got his rations from. I
watched that fellow and soon caught
onto his game. Every time the Yankees
would crowd us pretty close, and it
looked as if we would have to surrender
anyhow in the teeth of such overwhelming
numbers, this fellow’s horse would
get frightened and, in spite of all his
owner’s endeavors, would break away
with him to the rear. One day the fight
got terribly hot, our lines were cut
nearly in two, they swarmed over the
breastworks, it was a hand-to-hand fight.
To add to the demoralization, here came
this captain on his black horse, going
to the rear by the lines like wild, pulling
like Hercules on his horse’s mouth to
stop him, and shouting back as he flew
along:</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Gentlemen, I can’t stop him—he is
running away!’</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Hould on, Captain,’ shouted an Irishman
in our line, as he jumped up and
waved his cap at the horse and rider,
‘Hould on! I’ll give you a thousan’ dollars
to tell me where I can get another
one of that breed of horses that you
can’t hould when he starts to the rear.’</p>

<p class='c008'>“The Yankees took the shout of
laughter that followed Pat’s exclamation
for the Rebel yell and we got a breathing
spell at our end of the line for a
couple of hours.”</p>

<p>Nashville and Columbia pike in front of the Cheairs’ place, near Spring Hill, where the battle would have been fought had not Hood’s plans miscarried.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“That reminds me of Sam Watkins,”
said a gentleman present. “The same
Sam that wrote that inimitable book on
the war called “Company H”—the best
book I ever read on the war, for it came
nearer to painting it in its true, horrible
colors than any of them. Sam tells the
story as he went through it, from the
standpoint of a common soldier, and the
motto of his volume seems to have been
General Sherman’s laconic remark that
“War is hell.” If the young idiots
ever get up a notion to fight again, Sam
Watkins’ ‘Company H’ will do more to
stop them than anything I know of.
Anyway, just before the Battle of Shiloh
Sam found himself mounted on the stubbornest
mule that ever went to war.
He would charge Grant’s whole army
when the bugle sounded retreat, and
would proceed to fall precipitately back
when there wasn’t an enemy in a hundred
miles. On the first day at Shiloh,
when Johnston’s army was rushing over
everything before night, and Buell came,
Sam’s mule suddenly decided to retreat—and
retreat he did, much to Sam’s mortification
and disgust. As he went back
full tilt he ran over a gun with four
horses attached and before he recovered
from the shock of the collision to know
which way his rear end was, Sam tied a
rope to his neck and the other end of
the rope to the caisson’s axle, and having
mounted again he got the artilleryman to
literally haul his muleship into battle.
The fight was nearly over when they
finally got to the front, and, General
Johnston being killed, Beauregard had
ordered a cessation of hostilities till
morning. But it suddenly dawned on
Sam’s mule that he was expected to
charge, and no sooner was he released
than he straightened his neck, and before
his rider could dismount, straightened
his tail, brayed once and charged Grant’s
whole army, penned up on the banks of
the Tennessee River, and madder than
a gored bull in a fence corner. Sam’s
captain didn’t understand the mule’s
maneuvers, and as he went by shouted
to his men:</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Look at brave Sam Watkins, boys,
charging right in the cannon’s mouth.’</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“‘It ain’t me chargin’, Captain,’ shouted
poor Sam, as he pulled away with
all his might to keep out of certain
death—‘it ain’t me. I ain’t such a fool as
that. It’s this damned old mule! Whoa,
Baalam, whoa!’</p>

<p class='c008'>“I don’t know how that is,” remarked
a colonel who had seen hard service
on foot, “but I do know that we infantry
fellows had a holy contempt of
all cavalrymen. At the Battle of Murfreesboro
I was badly wounded in the
leg and arm, and for days I could
scarcely walk. As I was hobbling back
to the rear on the third day after the
fight, I met my brother mounted. As
soon as he saw my condition he got
down, helped me up on his horse and told
me how to ride out to find the hospital
surgeon. Now, in our brigade, we had
a standing reward of a thousand dollars
for anybody who would show us a dead
cavalryman. I had forgotten all about
this when all at once I rode into a Texas
regiment camping and fixing for supper.
My arm was in a sling, and from my
drooping position it was plain I was
wounded. As soon as they saw me one
of them yelled out:</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Run here, boys, run quick, and see
the curiosity of the century. Here is
a wounded cavalryman!’</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>The Lane of the Lost Opportunity, near Spring Hill, Tennessee, where Hood came so near cutting off Schofield.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>“And before I could get on they had
surrounded me and proceeded to make
life a greater burden. In vain I tried
to explain; as far as I went I heard only
one yell:</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Look at the wonder of the century!
Here is a real wounded cavalryman.
Sonny, how in the world did you ever
get that close to a bullet?’ and so on.
I got off of that horse as soon as I could
and never tried to play cavalry again
during the war.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I think it pretty well established,”
remarked General Jackson, “that the
greatest cavalry leader of the Confederacy
was Gen. N. B. Forrest. His career
was a curious one, as illustrating the
heights to which a natural genius, uneducated
though it may be, can go in its
chosen path. He had twenty-nine horses,
in all, killed under him during the war,
and yet came out unhurt save when a
minie ball one day ploughed through
his stirrup and the sole of his boot.
After the war, in which he rose to be a
lieutenant-general, his fame as a cavalry
leader had spread so far that during the
Franco-Prussian War, Napoleon III sent
a distinguished military tribunal over
here to get General Forrest’s mode of
fighting cavalry. On their way to Memphis
they stopped over at Belle Meade to
inspect my stud, and as I had seen a good
deal of service with Forrest I was telling
them of some of his ways of fighting cavalry.
Only one of them could speak English,
and I remember how the other two
laughed as I told their interpreter how
Forrest escaped annihilation by pure
audacity, on Hood’s retreat out of Tennessee,
of whose army his cavalry covered
the retreat. Forrest’s cavalry was
really mounted infantry, and he had in it
also two of the deadliest batteries in the
Civil War. On Hood’s retreat he saved
the army by planting his batteries and
checking the Federal advance—then,
when they came in overpowering numbers
he would fall back to another natural
hill breastwork and check them
again, while Hood was trying to get over
Duck River. But one time he came near
being annihilated. He held his ground
too long when suddenly an officer dashed
up and shouted:</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘General! General, we are ruined!
The enemy is in our rear. We will have
to surrender! What shall we do?’</p>

<p class='c008'>“‘Do? Do?’ shouted Forrest, as he
cursed the officer for a chicken-hearted
coward. ‘Is that all you know about war?
What will I do? In my rear, are they?
Well, I’ll just about face and then I’ll be
in them, won’t I?’ And he did, capturing
more prisoners than he could take into
the Tennessee River with him. The
French committee were highly amused,
and said such a course would never have
been thought of in European warfare.
I afterwards learned that the only information
they got from Forrest on their
visit was his now historic answer to
their question as to what was his rule
of warfare, to which he answered,
‘There ain’t but one rule—I always tried
to git thar fust with the most men.’
Now, the thoroughbred horse is the best
horse in Tennessee to ’git thar fust’ on,’”
laughed the general, “unless it is one
of Trotwood’s pacers,” he said, as he
winked my way, “and the only reason
they are fit for anything is because they
are built on the best kind of thoroughbred
lines, as he has admitted time and
again.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“I remember a laughable incident on
Hood’s retreat at a small creek between
Nashville and Columbia,” said another
old soldier present. “It was early morning,
cold and sleety. We had waded
the creek, but had to go back to help
pull the artillery over. As we came out
of the mud and water, a long line of
us tugging at a gun, a lank, solemn soldier
walked up on the bank, drew himself
up with great dignity, and in a sepulchral
voice said: “Fellow citizens!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Instantly every man stopped and listened
for some important announcement.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Fellow citizens,” went on the man,
in a deep, earnest tone, “aftah much
reflection an’ mature deliberation, I have
decided that South Carolina was a little
too hasty.”</p>

<p class='c008'>He was so solemn and earnest that
he was greeted with a big laugh and
shout.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

    <div><span class='sc'>By Ben McCulloch Hord</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>[The incidents in connection with this
great race, so graphically described by the
writer, were given him by an old turfman
who at that time was a young jockey and
witnessed the race.—Ed.]</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c011'>At the time of which I speak, there
were a number of famous horses on
the turf, necessarily producing much rivalry
between their various owners and
friends. The most prominent that I can
call to memory now were Boston, Duane,
Decatur, Vashti, Balie Peyton, Fannie
Wyatt, Charles Carter, Lady Clifton,
Clarion, etc. Boston was just beginning
to win the fame that afterward made his
name a household word throughout the
racing world, and nearly all of the best
horses of the day sought to measure
strides with this distinguished son of
Timoleon. In the language of an old
turfman, they were laying for him. At
this time Boston belonged to Mr. Nat
Reeves, of Richmond, Va., and after Decatur
had defeated Fannie Wyatt in a
four-mile heat race at Washington, D. C.,
Mr. James Long, a great admirer of Boston,
and a close friend of Mr. Reeves,
proposed to Captain Heath, the owner of
Decatur, to match Boston against him,
four-mile heats, for a purse of $10,000, to
be run at Camden, N. J., provided that he
could get the use of Boston for the race.
The match was accepted and $1,000 forfeit
put up. Mr. Long went over to Long
Island, where Mr. Reeves had Boston
attending the spring meeting, and made
known his match, which was agreed to.
Decatur was at Washington, while Duane
and Charles Carter, both in the same stable,
were gathering turf laurels at other
places. Boston had never gone four miles
up to this time, and there were many
prominent turfmen who doubted his ability
and courage to negotiate this distance
in good company, consequently as soon as
the match between him and Decatur became
known it made the latter largely
the choice in the betting, he having recently
defeated that good mare, Fannie
Wyatt, in the four-mile race above referred
to.</p>

<p class='c008'>Messrs. Reeves and Long, however,
were not slow in finding out Boston’s
courage—they were already satisfied as
to his speed—so they gave him a trial,
which was entirely satisfactory, he having
defeated in this trial his stable companion,
the celebrated Atlanta, 108 times the
length of Mr. Long’s walking stick, a
novel way, certainly, to measure distance,
but it was certainly done in this case, and
in those days horses were tried with
horses, and not by the watch, as now.</p>

<p class='c008'>Just before the match came off, the
Boston party concluded not to run, but
to pay forfeit, which they did. Their
idea was that they could bet their money
to better advantage in the four-mile
purse race, which was to come off in a
day or two, and in which both horses
would enter, knowing that Decatur would
be largely the favorite in the betting,
and even more so, as they had paid forfeit
to him. On the day of the race the
track was quite heavy. This also lengthened
the odds on Decatur. But Boston
won, after a close contest, and largely
enriched his friends. He was now considered
the champion racer of America, and
he was sent over to Long Island to attend
the second spring meeting, to come off in
a few weeks.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the meantime Duane and Charles
Carter had been winning fame and
most of the large purses in Maryland
and Virginia, under the management of
that shrewd and competent horseman,
Billy McCargo. They were now turned
toward the metropolis, with a view to
catching this new champion at Long
Island and taking a measure of his courage
and speed. McCargo thought either
of his horses was better than Decatur,
and as good, if not better, than Boston.
At Long Island he decided to make his
first battle on Boston with Charles Carter,
the lesser light of the two stars of the
turf. The horses came together in a four-mile
purse race, and for the character of
the soil and condition of the track, it
was the most fiercely-contested four-mile
dash I ever saw. The first three miles
were run in 5:36, the fastest, notwithstanding
the poor condition of the track,
ever made up to that time. As they passed
out on the fourth mile the horses were
going like a matched team, and the contest
appeared in great doubt, but on the
back side Boston began to draw away
and won easily by half a dozen lengths,
and when Carter came in it was seen that
he was broken down and had run his last
race.</p>

<p class='c008'>Boston and his friends now crossed
over to Hoboken, followed by McCargo,
with Duane. Over the new race course
on Beacon Heights it was decided that
Duane should give the champion a beating
or the race of his life. McCargo had
managed his fight on Boston with consummate
skill. He had selected the weaker
of his two horses, Charles Carter, to
make the first assault, and it was evident
from the terrific fight he had made over
the Long Island track that he hoped,
even if he could not win with Carter, to
at least run Boston such a race that he
could beat him with Duane on Beacon
Heights. Therefore they were quite sanguine
of victory and freely took all bets
offered.</p>

<p class='c008'>Beacon Heights was a new course just
opened near New York, easy of access,
and costing only a trifle to get from the
city there and to see the race. Excitement
was intense over the coming race
between these two famous Southern
champions, both sons of Virginia, and I
am confident that a hundred thousand
people witnessed the race. They came
from every section of the United States,
and all classes were represented. Mr. Van
Buren, who was then President, and all of
his Cabinet occupied a conspicuous place
in the grandstand, as did also nearly all
of the foreign legations, who were out in
full force. The beauty and chivalry of
the nation had assembled to witness what
was expected and what proved to be the
greatest horse race that ever occurred
in this or any other country. The great
sea of humanity was kept in the best of
humor by lively music from a number of
bands, the most noted being the United
States Marine Band, which had been sent
out in honor of the assembled dignitaries.</p>

<p class='c008'>In those days there was but little betting
done until the day of the race, and
most generally not until the horses were
on the track. On this occasion Commodore
Stockdon, who, besides being a
Commodore in our navy was also a true
sportsman and a prominent breeder and
importer of thoroughbreds, and who
owned and raced some prominent horses
of the day, proposed on the evening before
the race to Mr. Pringle, the most
noted sporting man of that day, in Washington,
that he would bet him $5,000 on
Duane, provided he liked the looks of the
horse the next day. The bet was promptly
taken, and the next day when the
horses were brought out, after carefully
inspecting Duane, the Commodore told
Pringle it was “a go.” This settled it.
No money passed, and rarely ever did
with big bettors. In those days men’s
words were sufficient. What a striking
difference between then and now! Here
a Commodore in the navy bets $5,000
with a noted gambler, with nothing more
than the word “go” between them, and
yet either would have sold the clothes
off his back rather than to crawfish out
of the bet, or in any way defraud the
other. This even bet seemed to make the
mark for others to go by, and the money
went on even up, and by the cartload in
sums from fifty to five and ten thousand
dollars a side. As a rule the Southern
contingent backed Duane, while the New
Yorkers piled their wealth on Boston. McCargo’s
mulatto boy, Steve, who had ridden
Carter against Boston, at Long Island,
was now up on Duane to make another
desperate effort to down the champion,
while Cornelius, Boston’s old rider, a
negro boy who belonged to Mr. Reeves,
the owner of the horse, was in the pigskin
on his favorite.</p>

<p class='c008'>After having gone through the racing
season, running from two to four mile heat
races every week, the two horses,
as they stepped out on the track, looked
like two gamecocks made of whalebone
and steel. Every muscle and sinew stood
out as if carved by an artist’s chisel,
while their glossy coats, bright eyes and
light, springy step indicated that both
were on edge and ready to run for a
king’s ransom or a woman’s love. Boston
was a red sorrel, about fifteen hands three
inches high, both hind ankles white and
a white strip on his face that broadened
out over the nose; hence the nickname of
“Old White Nose” afterward given to
him by his friends. He was a horse of
immense driving power, but so very symmetrical
in his proportions and so evenly
balanced that it was only noticeable in
the eyes of a critic. As he moved about
under Cornelius quietly, but with a supple,
catlike step, bearing lightly on the
snaffle, with his red coat gleaming in
the sunshine like burnished gold, he
was as beautiful and grand-looking a specimen
of race horse as ever gladdened the
eyes of a turfman. Duane, the son of
imported Hedgford, was the counterpart
of Boston in every respect, except in
color and markings. He was a dark
brown, almost black, with tan muzzle and
flanks. While Boston’s coat shone like
gold, Duane looked like polished bronze.
He had no marks, except a small spot of
white in his forehead that shone like a
diamond, and as he was led out on the
course by his old negro trainer, Lazarus,
with yellow Steve in the saddle, followed
by their manager, Billy McCargo, they
presented a picture that will live forever
in the memory of every turfman who saw
them. Gilpatrick, the most distinguished
jockey of his day, afterwards the rider
of Boston in all of his races, and who
rode Lexington in his memorable race
against time, and I, both young riders
then and fast friends, pooled our hard-earned
wages, amounting to $13, and bet
it all on Boston, and with beating hearts
we worked our way through the crowd
and took position under the wire directly
opposite the judges. Hon. John C. Stevens,
one of New York’s most prominent
citizens, an accomplished gentleman and
the most competent starter of his day,
was in the stand and ordered out the
horses.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>First Heat.</h3>

<p class='c015'>At the tap of the drum the battle began.
Duane was first on his stride and showed
the way around the turn. Here Boston
made a run and shortly after entering
the stretch was on even terms with him.
Head and head they passed the stand.
A mighty shout went up from the vast
crowd and as they started on the second
mile you could hear, “$500 on Duane!”
“A $1,000 on Boston!” “Watch him run
him out!” “Stay with him, old white
nose!” and a thousand other such exclamations
from the friends of each. Rounding
the lower turn, Duane having the
track, Cornelius took a slight pull on
Boston, but on entering the back stretch
he made a run and at the half they were
nearly lapped. Rounding the upper turn,
however, Duane shook him off. Another
shout from the backers of Duane and
more money goes up. Entering the
stretch the game son of Timoleon makes
another run at his flying antagonist, and,
although he closes up the space, he can
only get on Duane’s hip, and in this
order, head and hip, they pass the stand
and swing around the turn. Cornelius
is content to hold this position until he
enters the back stretch, when he again
calls on Boston; slowly but surely the
red coat of Boston inches up and at the
half is hid behind Duane. So even are
they running that it looks like one horse
and one rider; in this position they ran
around the upper turn, down the home
stretch and enter the fourth mile as
even as a carriage team with the deafening
shouts of the multitude following
them. Rounding the lower turn Steve
for the first time takes a pull on
Duane, evidently with a view of saving
him for the finish; Cornelius on Boston
moves to the front, intending to take
the track, but Steve has no idea of giving
up this advantage, and he keeps
Duane moving just close enough to keep
Boston on the outside. In this position
they race to the head of the stretch.
Here Steve begins to make a run; down
the stretch they come, hip and head, but
in spite of all Cornelius’ efforts and in
spite of the long, tireless strides of Boston,
the brown son of Hedgford overhauls
him when half-way down the
stretch, but it has taken the last remnant
of his reserve power to do this, and
head to head, leap for leap, they strain
their hardened muscles. A child’s blanket
would have covered them. Both
riders were rolling in their saddles from
exhaustion, but were lifting and urging
all they could. Boston had been running
purely on his courage. Cornelius
had neither whip nor spur. Steve had
on spurs that had more than once in the
finish drawn the claret from Duane. “A
dead heat!” “A dead heat!” shout the
crowd. No. One more stride with a
savage dig that sent the rowels home in
the quivering flanks of his horse and at
the same time lifting his head Steve
sends Duane under the wire a winner
by a scant head, in 7:52.</p>

<p class='c008'>Remarkable time for a new track filled
with roots and sprouts. Both horses
showed distress when the boys returned
to weigh out. It had been a battle between
giants, and their heaving flanks
gave evidence of the great physical
strain they had undergone, but the same
gamecock look flashed from their eyes,
showing that while the flesh might be
weak their courage could never die. The
riders were scarcely less distressed.
Steve, the rider of Duane, fainted when
taken down, and Cornelius was in but
little better condition. So popular was
the victory of Duane that Mr. Wm.
Friend, of Virginia, bought him before
the next heat was called, paying his
owner $12,000 for him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although he had lost a heat Boston’s
friends asked and received no odds, but
still covered Duane money, even up.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>Second Heat.</h3>

<p class='c015'>When the horses were called for the second
heat they came up looking well.
Both had cooled out admirably. Johnny
Hartman, a white jockey, and one of the
best riders on the turf, was upon Duane,
Steve not being able to resume his
mount. Up to this time Boston had
never been marked by whip or spur, except
in his first race, when he sulked
when touched with a spur. He had won
all of his races running purely on his
courage. Col. Wm. R. Johnson, the “Napoleon
of the Turf,” who was managing
him in this race, procured a cowhide, and
when he mounted Cornelius gave it to
him with instructions to use it if necessary
from start to finish. There was no
delay at the post; the drum tapped, and
they were off, followed by the continuous
cheers of the crowd. I doubt if a more
closely contested match for four miles
was ever run over any course than was
waged between these two great horses
in this second heat. It was literally a
fight to the death. With every muscle
strained, every sinew drawn to its utmost
tension, they raced head for head
the entire distance. Duane was on the
inside and held it to the finish, although
Boston made repeated efforts in every
mile to take it. It was drive, drive,
drive; death or victory. First the head
of gold striped with white would for a
moment show in front, then the head
of bronze with the white spot gleaming
like a star of hope would take the lead,
but never more than a scant head would
at any time divide them. As the head
of either horse would show in front their
respective friends would give a ringing
cheer, but as mile after mile of the
mighty contest was measured off by the
long, low, powerful strides of these great
racers and the desperate character of the
race became more and more apparent,
the excitement became too intense for
shouting, and as the horses turned into
the stretch on the fourth mile for the
run home nose to nose, bit to bit and
stride for stride a stillness as of death
came over the crowd. Not a shout, not a
word, not a whisper was heard. The
stable boys and rubbers with bated
breath and bulging eyes stared with almost
agonized expression on their faces
up the stretch where the desperate battle
was being fought. The lemonade
vender gave up all thoughts of trade,
and even the wily pickpocket forgot his
calling for the moment, and his hand,
still clutching his ill-gotten gains, trembled
with excitement as he watched the
flying stallions and heard the ceaseless
patter of their hoof strokes.</p>

<p class='c008'>I was a young light-weight jockey then
who had won his spurs in more than one
hotly-contested field, and to-day am perhaps
the only living turfman who witnessed
this great match, for nearly sixty
years have passed since then; yet in
memory’s mirror, I can see that fearful
finish as distinctly as my young eyes
saw it that day. I can see two horses
half-way down the stretch coming as
true and even as two arrows from one
bow. I can see two outstretched necks
and heads, a sorrel and a brown, a blaze
and a star. I can see their powerful
haunches gathered under them and drive
them forward as if they were shot from
the mouth of a cannon. I can see the
hard-trained muscles playing beneath
their thin skins like oiled machinery, and
as they come nearer and nearer I see
their ears lying back and their bloodshot
eyes gleaming with the light of the
battle and undying courage. I hear their
labored breathing and can see the red
flush up their widely-distended nostrils
glowing like heated furnaces. I can see
Johnny Hartman, pale as death, riding
as if for his life, drive the merciless
steel again and again in the panting
sides of Duane, and at each time the
blood spurting from the wounds. I can
see the black face of Cornelius, drawn
as if in mortal agony, his lips parted,
his white teeth shining and his eyes
fixed on the finishing point only a few
yards away. I can see him swing the
cowhide, already crimsoned with the
royal blood of Boston, high over his
head and bring it down on the quivering
flank of his horse, then, quick as lightning,
lift him with the bit. I can see
the great son of Timoleon crouch lower
to the ground, gather his powerful quarters
further under him and make the
final rush just as Cornelius lifts him,
and I can see the golden head and white
nose cross the wire in front of the bronze
and the star. Boston wins, but only by a
head. Then the pent-up excitement
broke forth. “Boston wins!” “Boston
wins!” was the shout. Yes, he had won,
but could he do so again? This was only
a heat apiece. Another heat was necessary
to decide the race, and in the peerless
brown stallion he had found a foeman
well worthy of his steel, and one
that had shown him he could take his
measure in any part of the four miles.
Both horses had been fearfully punished
and were dreadfully distressed, and so
were the riders. Of the two latter Hartman
was much the freshest, for after
weighing out Cornelius had to be rubbed
out, drenched with brandy and altogether
requiring almost as much attention as
his horse. But he would have died in
the saddle rather than have relinquished
his mount, and when they were
called for the last heat he came out with
his bloody whip, looking as determined
as ever.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>Third Heat.</h3>

<p class='c015'>Gilpatrick and I took our old position
under the wire, with many misgivings as
to the fate of our combined fortunes, the
$13 that hung upon the result of this
heat. For the first time Boston began to
show the ugly side of his disposition by
sulking. As they were led up to start he
repeatedly refused to go, and when the
drum was finally tapped, having the inside,
he bolted toward the fence. Cornelius
pulled him out, and then he ran diagonally
across the track towards the outside.
In the meantime Hartman was
sending the dead game son of Hedgford,
along, and by the time Cornelius got
Boston straight and on his stride the
magnificent brown had taken the track
and was running smoothly more than
fifty yards in front. These positions
were maintained until they reached the
head of the stretch. Here Boston showed
another peculiar trait in his disposition,
and one for which he afterwards became
noted, the shouting of a crowd
seemed to inspire him and make him
run faster. As they turned into the
stretch with Duane so far in advance his
friends began to cheer. The sound no
sooner reached Boston’s ears than he
began of his own accord to make a run
at Duane, and so rapidly did he run
down the stretch that when they passed
under the wire he was only two open
lengths away. Going around the lower
turn both riders eased up their horses,
but on entering the back stretch Cornelius
made a run with Boston at Duane
and at the half mile had closed out all
the daylight between them.</p>

<p class='c008'>But rounding the upper turn Duane
shook him off and entered the stretch an
open length and a half in front. Again a
great shout went up from the backers of
the peerless brown stallion as they saw
his move, and again as the sound reached
Boston it seemed to lend him wings.
Running true and straight as a bullet
flies, without touch of whip, the whitefaced
son of Timoleon began to devour
the space that separated him from his
antagonist, and as they passed the stand
at the end of the second mile his white
nose was at Duane’s hip. Going around
the lower turn the boys again took easy
pulls on their horses, and in this position
they go up the stretch and around the
upper turn, Boston holding his place
with the tenacity of a bull dog. But the
white star of Duane is still in front as
they swing into the stretch, and again his
backers greet him with a cheer and again
“old white nose” takes the compliment
to himself and promptly, in response, he
quickens his stride and again reaches
Duane. Half-way down the stretch he
collars him, and as they pass the stand
his white nose is in front for the first
time since starting on this last heat. It
was now the time for Boston’s friends to
cheer, and if pandemonium had broken
loose more noise could not have been
made. Men were simply wild with excitement.
They danced about like children;
hats, coats and canes were thrown
into the air. Gilpatrick and I hugged
each other and shouted ourselves hoarse,
and, as the horses rounded the lower
turn, the shouting increased, as it was
seen that Boston, inspired by the shouting,
no doubt, had kept up his killing
stride and had taken the track from
Duane. But to experienced riders like
Gil and I this sudden change in position
was rather a source of uneasiness. We
both knew Hartman well. He was every
inch a rider and a cool and skillful horseman,
and we could see that he had taken
a strong pull on his horse, saving him for
the terrific finish he knew was yet to
come. Knowing from our own experience
in the saddle what was coming we paid
no attention to the over-sanguine friends
of Boston shouting: “Duane has quit!”
“Duane has quit!” We knew the horse
and we knew the rider, and we also knew
that a race for life was coming and our
fortunes were on the issue. So we anxiously
watched them as they raced nose
and tail, with Boston leading up the back
side and around the upper turn.</p>

<p class='c008'>Just before entering the stretch for
home Hartman began to move on Duane.
“He’s coming!” “He’s coming!” Gil whispered,
for he was too excited to speak,
and we both stood speechless watching
the fierce battle that was opening a
quarter of a mile away. Cornelius rides
Boston a little wide on turning in the
stretch in order that his whip hand might
be free to drive. Hartman sees the opening
thus made next the rail and rushes
Duane in it. It was skillful riding on
both sides. Hartman had no whip, but
rode with spurs, while Cornelius had no
spurs, for Boston would not stand them,
but rode with a whip, and if Hartman in a
tight finish could get so close to Cornelius
on his whip side as to prevent him
from using the lash he would have a big
advantage. This Cornelius prevented by
riding a little out on the turn. The spurt
of Duane was greeted with the old-time
cheer of his backers. “He comes! he
comes!” “See him come!” went up from
the throats of thousands, but it ceased
almost as suddenly as it began, for the
red horse is coming with him, and at
that moment not a hand’s breadth divides
them. But Hartman’s judgment in
saving his horse now begins to tell, and
inch by inch the brown stud begins to
slowly but surely draw away. First a
nose, then a head, then a neck and
shoulders he pushes to the front. Hartman’s
knee is at Boston’s head. Duane
is a half length in front and only an
eighth of a mile to run. Can he hold?
Cornelius shifts both reins to his left
hand, the cat-gut whirls above his head
and falls upon the flank of Boston, cutting
the thin skin of the thoroughbred
like a knife. Maddened with pain and
his own desire to win Boston bites savagely
at Duane, but catches Hartman’s
trousers at the knee and nearly tears
them off of the jockey. Cornelius pulls
him loose, lifts his head, straightens him
and again the cruel rawhide tastes his
blood. Responding to the lash with unfaltering
courage, with the shouts of
“Duane,” “Duane,” “Duane wins!” ringing
in his ears, the great horse with almost
human instinct seems to know that
the supreme moment has come, as he
puts forth the last vital ounce of strength
that yet lingers in his powerful muscles
and begins to draw up on Duane. Each
weary leap brings him nearer and nearer
the head of the gallant brown, whose
last rush at the head of the stretch is
now beginning to tell upon him. Only
fifty feet from the wire and they are nose
and nose. Horses and riders were rolling
from side to side, all utterly exhausted.
Still, with outstretched necks, distended
nostrils and eyes yet flaming with
passion, the fierce contest goes on as
they literally stagger towards the finish,
for the pace is now nothing more than a
hard gallop. Cornelius is reeling from
exhaustion in his saddle, but with a last
effort he partially lifts the drooping head
of Boston, cuts him with the whip and—the
race is over! Boston wins! But
so dead tired are both horses that Boston,
although the winner, actually
stopped directly under the wire, and
Duane walked under it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fortune has been kind to me since
then and given me many of her most
choice blessings, but never in her most
liberal moods has she given me anything
that I appreciated more than the smile
she gave me that hot day on Beacon
Heights nearly sixty years ago, when,
watching this greatest of all the great
races I have ever seen, she doubled my
humble fortune.</p>

<p class='c008'>The reason so little has ever been said
or written about this race is owing to
the fact that it was not a match or stake
or section race, but simply a purse race
of four mile heats, in which two of the
most noted horses in America met. I
helped to carry Boston home after the
race. We went through by land, and so
completely exhausted was the horse that
he would frequently fall and we would
have to assist him to his feet.</p>

<p class='c008'>As a rule, traveling salesmen manage
to extract and radiate as much joy and
mirth as any class of citizens that I
know of. But even these genial spirits
have their own sorrows.</p>

<p class='c008'>A drummer was sent by his house,
shortly after his marriage, on a long
trip to the Pacific coast. Some time
after his departure the young wife was
seized with appendicitis, was hurried off
to a hospital, operated on, and recovered
all right. The strain, both mental
and financial, had been great, but she
was well again. Joe had remitted by
check for surgeon’s fee, special nurse,
hospital charges, and a few other items
amounting to a hundred or so, and his
spirits were just beginning to rise again
as he worked towards Los Angeles,
where mail from home would await him.</p>

<p class='c008'>The “gang” from the 9:10 train hurried
up to the office of the “Link-Schmidt.”
The night clerk handed each
his quota of these ever-welcome missives.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the reading room Joe was seen to
turn deathly pale. Several at once approached.
“What’s matter, old boy?”
“Bad news from home?” “Anything out
of whack?” and kindred interrogatories
were fired at him from all directions.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some griefs are too poignant for expression.
Carefully folding back the
first and last parts of a page, Joe exhibited,
without comment, only this paragraph
of its perfumed surface: “I am
not feeling as well, dearest, as when I
wrote you at Pasadena. Sallie is coming
over to-morrow and we are going to
have our kimonos cut out.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Reader number one passed it down the
line. Silence, that was stifling, settled
over the group. Then, moved by a common
impulse, a solemn procession filed
out and lined up before a rosewood counter,
in front of which ran a massive gilt
rail. “Martini,” “Black and White High
Ball,” “Wilson,” “Same.”
In the land of the high ball a poet once

<p class='c008'>I have read with much interest your
history of that remarkable family of pacers.
If the Hal family of pacers can’t
produce world’s record-breaking trotters,
the theory that extreme trotting speed
comes from the pacer, or originated from
the pacing gait, must go to the wall.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Wallace was certainly misinformed
when he was told that the dam
of Vermont Black Hawk was a pacer.
I hunted up the man who had charge
of her for upwards of eight years, and
he assured me that the dam of Vermont
Black Hawk was as square gaited a
trotter as he ever saw, and that she
never paced a step during all the time
she was owned in the Twombly family.
This man was Mr. Shadrak Seavey, a
grandson of Ezekiel Twombly, and men
who knew him personally assured me
that no man’s reputation for strict veracity
was superior to that of Mr. Seavey.
Horsemen who knew this mare
agreed unanimously with Mr. Seavey in
describing her color, size, conformation
and gait.</p>

<p class='c008'>The man who misled Mr. Wallace got
on the track of the wrong mare. He
was the same man (Allen W. Thompson,
of Woodstock, Vt.) who strenuously contended
that Vermont Black Hawk was
by Paddy, and Ethan Allen 2:25½ was
by Adams’ Flying Morgan, in spite of
the fact that the stud book of Sherman
Morgan showed that the dam of Vermont
Black Hawk was mated with him
May 14, 1832, and I learned from Mr.
Seavey that Black Hawk was foaled
about the middle of April, 1833.</p>

<p class='c008'>The stud service book of Vermont
Black Hawk shows that the Holcomb
mare, dam of Ethan Allen, was mated
with Black Hawk July 9, 1848. It is a
matter of history that Ethan Allen was
foaled June 18, 1849. These facts were
known to Thompson, but because Ethan
Allen was bay in color, Thompson was
sure there must have been some mistake.
He did not succeed in winning
Mr. Wallace on that point, but touched
a responsive chord when he hit upon the
pacing mare as the dam of Vermont
Black Hawk.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>As to Football.</h3>

<div class='lg-container-l c009'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Editor Trotwood’s:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c008'>In college and university circles, during
the year 1905, one of the vital questions
receiving its share of attention
was, as some one has aptly phrased it,
“Is football to be mended or ended?”
This and similar questions open the subject
for discussion, in the progress of
which a number of very caustic criticisms
have been leveled at the game by
the presidents of some of our great universities
and colleges and members of
their respective faculties. The president
of Columbia University, the first to abolish
the game, recently declared that football
as now played is no longer a sport,
but a profession, and, like other professions,
demands prolonged training, complete
absorption of time and thought,
and is inconsistent, in practice, at least,
with the devotion to work which is
the first duty of college and university
students. He also calls attention to the
“figure” “gate receipts” cuts in the conduct
of the game, which, says he, “marks
the game as in no small degree a commercial
enterprise.” President Wheeler
of the University of California, brings
his indictment against the promoters of
the modern game for “having changed
the gridiron into a multiplication table,”
and otherwise tampering with it, until
to-day “American intercollegiate football
has become a spectacle, and not a sport.”
The president of the College of the City
of New York reviews the evolution of
football, and makes a strong plea for
a return to the game of earlier times,
“when football was rather primitive;
few practice hours, few out-of-town
games; no training table; no excuse
from regular university work, and the
boys led a normal student life.” However,
whatever may be the opinion of certain
scholastic dignitaries, and however
incompetent the “rank outsider” may be
to judge the game, a reasonable survey
of the situation reveals the fact that public
opinion, the most powerful factor
with which we have to deal, is now concentrating
its forces preparatory to
“bucking the centre” of the game as
played, or, with the “flying wedge” of
reform, dash through its lines and destroy
the dangerous features of the
“mass play.”</p>

<p class='c008'>That there should be provision for
physical culture in the course of every
educational institution is, of course, universally
conceded, but the question now
up for solution is, what character of
exercise, or what system of physical development
will come nearer meeting the
demand for such training. The champions
of the great American game answer,
“football.” And yet, when we consider
the question in the light of all its
pros and cons—and, like all other questions,
it has its pros and cons—its three
sides—i. e., your side, the other side, and
the inside—we are led to believe that it
specializes athletic sports to such a degree
as to exclude the student body from
participation in them. The systematic
development of the physique was first
given a pre-eminent place in the training
and discipline of young men by the
ancient Greeks, who sought in this way
to perpetuate a hardy and vigorous manhood
among their people. The origin
of the Greek games is mythical, yet we
know that they were revived in 776 by
the king of Elia and Lycurgus, the
Spartan lawgiver, as a means by which
intestine commotions might be pacified
and a pestilence which at that time
plagued the people, stayed. Foot racing,
wrestling, leaping, quoit and javelin
throwing, and, in time, chariot racing
were the chief sports with which
they developed the physical manhood of
the nation. And in this connection, but
a moment’s reflection is required to suggest
the benefits derived from such a
variety of sports and diversity of exercise.
Contrast the sports of the Greek
game with the exclusive feature of football
as played in the colleges to-day. A
college president writes of his institution:
“In the ten years from 1892 to
1902, only seventy-five different men
made the team as players and substitutes
out of four thousand or more different
male students during that time
in attendance.” But this is an age of
“specialists,” therefore we will let that
pass, and there yet remains the gravest
possible objections to the “mass” game.
It cannot be denied with any show of
fairness, that its present tendency is to
discredit scholarship and put brains at
a discount, while it inflates and exaggerates
the intrinsic value of beef and
bone. The primary object of education
is to discipline and develop all the faculties
and endowments of heart and
head, while the maxim, “a sound mind
in a sound body,” is by no means to
be despised, and yet the hero of the gridiron,
the idol of the college or university,
might be a young man of mediocre ability,
or with no brains at all, and
with less character than brains. Then,
again, the exaggerated importance which
the average student attaches to the more
brutal features of the game creates a
false standard of courage and manhood,
and demands ferocious tests that are
unfair as the price of its vindication.
False standards of anything in life are,
especially to the young, always perilous,
and of nothing is this more than
of false conceptions of what constitutes
real courage. For instance, it is a notorious
fact that in the hour of actual
battle soldiers who, in “the piping times
of peace,” were renowned fist-fighters
and bullies, and generally looked upon
as “bold, bad men,” have, when the thunder
of cannon and the rattle of musketry
broke upon their ears, failed to stand the
test of courage, and disgracefully and ignominiously
fled, seeking safety in precipitate
flight, while other men, supposed
to be physical cowards, walked
calmly and dutifully, and with unwavering
step, on through the storm of grape
and shell into the very jaws of death.
We are reminded, in this connection,
that the “dunghill” fights splendidly with
his “natural heels,” but it takes a game
cock to stand the test of “steel.” Ought
our young men to be educated in an atmosphere
in which such base estimates
of true courage and manliness must become
the very breath of their nostrils?
Should a young man of culture, courage,
refinement and a high sense of honor
be subjected to the humiliation of being
accounted a “cad” by his fellow students
because he does not happen to
aspire to “make good” on the team or
approve the game? Such a young man
may be a swift runner, a good rider, and
a well trained gymnast, but there is no
field for his physical development if he
does not “make good,” and though he
be manly, straightforward and proficient
in his work, he has no show with the
students with the commonest, vulgarest
and most ill-bred youth imaginable,
provided that “darling of the gods” happens
to weigh enough and have enough
of the bulldog and tiger in him. Is it
any wonder that the brutality of the
game, with all its barbarisms and degrading
tendencies, has at last awakened
the sleeping giant of public opinion, who
now threatens to destroy it? And what
complicates the situation more are the
revelations that from time to time have
been made, fixing the crime of dishonesty
and insincerity upon some of the
faculties of schools and colleges, who
have taken devious and questionable
ways and methods to violate their sworn
agreements with rival institutions, and
persistently play professionals as students.
But the foxy methods of such
schools and colleges have most naturally
tended to disintegrate the student
conscience and re-acted upon their faculties
so as to do either one of two
things—i. e., cause the faculty to forfeit
the confidence of the better class of students,
or train the student to feel that
there is no wrong in dissembling, cheating
or lying where the success of the
team is at stake, as well as the reputation
of their college as a leader in
athletic sports.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such a state of affairs most naturally
has aroused the interest of those who
are jealous and zealous for the welfare
of the colleges and universities and individual
students, and the tide of public
opinion has gradually been swelling
until now it threatens the utter destruction
of the game. But will the students
themselves come to the rescue and save
the game while there is yet time, by
agreeing to an honest, clean abolition of
the objectionable features of the game?
For, in the last analysis of the situation,
it is “up to them.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The lien laws of most of the Southern
states should be repealed. They have
served their purpose, and are no longer
needed. They are millstones around the
neck of twentieth century progress. To
the uninitiated it may be necessary to
explain that these laws make it possible
to use as collateral for a loan things
not yet in existence. It is a mortgage
on air, sunshine, rain and prospects. The
renter of a small farm goes, say in
January, to a village merchant, states
how much land he will plant, what he
expects the total yield will be and
the merchant then agrees to advance
him, from time to time, supplies of all
kinds—food, clothing, implements, and
so on, up to an agreed upon amount.
For this amount the merchant takes a
lien or mortgage upon the prospective
crop.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cotton crop is not planted until
April or May, so that a goodly part of
the supplies are consumed before a seed
is in the ground.</p>

<p class='c008'>The wreck and ruin of a four years’
war left little besides the land of the
South, and the enactment of these laws
was an expedient adopted to meet an
emergency. The necessity for them has
long since passed, leaving the laws on
the statute books. They have not been
repealed because politicians are afraid
of the poor man’s vote. They lack that
independence that would do what is
best for him over his protest. That such
laws encourage idleness, dependence,
thriftlessness and improvidence among
those who most need to practice their
opposites is well illustrated by the following
actual occurrence.</p>

<p class='c008'>One afternoon last August a friend of
mine came upon a white renter sitting
on the bank of Saluda river fishing.
During the conversation my friend expressed
the hope that the long drought
might be broken by a shower, whereupon
the fisherman replied: “Yes, my
melon patch needs hit powerful bad, but
I’ve drawed about all I kin git on my
cotton patch anyway, and I don’t care
whether a drap falls on hit or not.”</p>

  <h2 id='TROTWOOD' class='c005'>With Trotwood</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The great new South—does it not
make one proud to read the record on
a preceding page.</p>

<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c008'>Trotwood begs to thank personally
the hundreds of friends who write him
weekly kind things about the Monthly—not
only for encouraging letters, but
the more substantial evidence of their
appreciation. No one but he who is
making a life fight for what is best in
literature knows how much come-again
such letters put into the man who lives
in his den at home thinking out what
he hopes will please and instruct. So
do not imagine you will weary him by
writing. He needs them all.</p>

<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c008'>Trotwood’s is indebted to Miss Julia
A. Royster, of Raleigh, N. C., for the
realistic picture of mammy in this issue.
The picture of Jake, in the January number,
was also Miss Royster’s, and we
have obtained many more typical Southern
pictures by this artist—the truest
and most sympathetic we have yet seen.
Miss Royster will supply these and other
Southern pictures, most artistically executed,
to those who care for them.</p>

<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c008'>I wish to compliment Mr. Brownlow
on his able article on “Monetary Relief,”
writes Mr. Denison, of Fargo, N.
D. “The plan is a perfect panacea if
we could get a guarantee that bank
presidents would keep their fingers out
of speculation.” Mr. Brownlow’s plan
seems to meet the approval of all thinking
men. By limiting the amount which
each bank may be permitted to use, restricting
the large banks to half a million,
and permitting all the small ones
to issue to the extent of their capital
stock, Mr. Brownlow’s plan most effectually
keeps it out of the hands of speculators.
We believe when Mr. Brownlow’s
plan is thoroughly known it will
be the one adopted.</p>

<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c008'>“I think you have struck the right
‘lead’ in your Monthly,” writes Prof.
Sterling C. Bremer, of the Link School,
Thomasville, Tenn. “Unless a Southern
magazine is distinctively Southern, it
has no right to exist in the South. If it
is going to give us a lot of syndicate,
ready-made goods, it had better go to
New York, where the facilities for that
kind of publication are the best. So
continue to give us a Trotwood’s
Monthly, and not a feeble imitation of
some Northern magazine, and I think
you will be supported.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Trotwood appreciates the criticism
above, from a scholar in one of the best
schools in the South. The more so because
we do not claim any particular
credit for making Trotwood’s different.
We are picturing naturally the life
around us—its songs, traditions and
ideals. We could make our Monthly
twice as large by using syndicate matter.
But it will add nothing to the
thought of the Monthly nor to its quality.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here are some good ones from a little
book called “Philosophy of the Street,”
by E. R. Petherick, of Merrill, Wisconsin.
There are hundreds more in the
book as good, and that is saying much:</p>

<p class='c008'>Two people may differ and both be
wrong.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ridicule is a cross-eyed cousin of wit.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many of us devote too much energy
to increasing our wants.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is always easy to get a front place
by facing the other way.</p>

<p class='c008'>The man who has no secrets from
his wife is a widower.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cunning is the selfish side of wisdom.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is a good idea to remember that
the present is constantly becoming the
past.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is about as much sense in judging
a man by his talk as there would
be in buying a dog by his bark.</p>

<p class='c008'>Few people know how to be good to
themselves.</p>

<p class='c008'>After a man has received two favors
in succession, he begins to consider them
part of his constitutional right.</p>

<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c008'>“It may interest you to know,” writes
Prof. Henry C. Cox, of The Froebel Public
School, Chicago, “that on Christmas
Eve sixteen hundred and sixty-seven
children of this school sang one of your
Christmas poems set to music.”</p>

<p class='c008'>It not only interests us, but it makes
us exceedingly vain. To live in the
hearts of children! Who would swap
them for the sages? And that reminds
us of several bright things of children—neighbors
of Trotwood—so bright that
we thought once of sending them to the
Ladies’ Home Journal, an awfully nice
female paper published in Philadelphia,
but we have decided they are good
enough for Trotwood’s:</p>

<p class='c008'>Little Octavine had lived upstairs at
grandmother’s all her short life of four
summers, and objected often to walking
up the steps. Recently her parents
moved to Nashville. Everybody knows
what a beautiful Union Station Nashville
has, but what an abominably long flight
of steps leads from the tracks up to the
street. Little Octavine slowly and painfully
climbed them, and when she
reached the top sighed and said, woefully:
“Mamma, if you had told me Nashville
was upstairs I never would have
moved here.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Little Ethel, aged two, who can barely
talk, saw for the first time the Jersey
cow chewing her cud the other day.
Ethel watched her long and eagerly, but
the more she yearned the more indifferent
the cow chewed on. Finally she began
to cry: “Mamma, make her let me—chew
it—awhile!”</p>

<p class='c008'>Henry’s mother had been operated on
for appendicitis. He didn’t know exactly,
but supposed there was an awful
rent somewhere. One day he came in
in time to see the nurse giving his mother
a glass of water. “Don’t do that,” he
shouted; “don’t do that! Don’t you
know it will just run out of her?”</p>

<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c008'>In reading some of the business letters
on file in Trotwood’s the other day I
came across a letter and its answer that
made me catch my breath. When I
reached the P. S. I had the same laugh
that you will have—and as a laugh is
always worth money, I am passing it
on to Trotwood’s readers. The letter
is from our friend, F. D. Hoogstraat, Ravenna,
Mich., who, after saying many
kind things about us and enclosing check
for five subscribers to Trotwood’s, ends
with the following friendly bit of fun:
“I was out your way forty-odd years
ago, and I killed as many of you as
you did of me, and I feel now that every
thing is square and even between us.”</p>

<p class='c008'>I turned over the carbon copy containing
the business manager’s reply,
and this is what I read toward the latter
part of the letter: “We will be glad
to have you come this way again, and
we’ll promise to give you a ‘warm reception,’
but not the kind we gave you before.
The same Johnnies who tried to
kill you forty years ago with bullets will
try it again with kindness and moonshine
whisky. They will charge you with a
handshake instead of a bayonet and
will put you in the best bed instead of a
prison. The people of the South look
forward and not backward, and have
long ago forgotten and forgiven.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Here is a sample letter received; and
we get them every day, and above all we
are glad to get them and very grateful
for them: “I have been taking TROTWOOD’S
MONTHLY for the past five
months and I want to say to you that I
never invested a dollar in my life that I
thought I got as much enjoyment out of
as I have the one I sent you for TROTWOOD’S
MONTHLY. I hope all who
take it are as well pleased as myself.
Frank Harrington, Eau Claire, Wis.”</p>

<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c008'>Here is another from Mr. F. L. Wacholz,
cashier of the First National Bank,
Forest City, Iowa: “I find TROTWOOD’S
MONTHLY to be one of the most interesting
magazines that I have read in
recent years. The contents are suitable
for any man, woman or child to read with
pleasure and profit.”</p>

<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c008'>If you are “from Missouri” read this
one: “Tell your agent in Prattville that
I will refund the money to any one subscribing
to TROTWOOD’S MONTHLY
if they are not satisfied with it. McQueen
Smith, Prattville, Ala.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Smith can refund if called on, for
he had 1,200 acres of cotton in one field
last year.</p>

<p class='c008'>If you feel inclined to help us along—if
you think we deserve help—you can do
us a great favor by asking your friends
to send for a sample copy, or send us
their names and we will send the sample
copy.</p>

<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c008'>We have received several letters within
the past month from northern subscribers
asking for information in regard
to the South. We are always glad to give
any information within our power, and
will endeavor to stick just as close to
facts as information in our possession
will enable us.</p>

<p class='c008'>Advertisers when spending money for
advertising space want to know where
their inquiries come from. If you will
always mention that you saw the advertisement

we will appreciate it. We protect you
by running nothing but clean and reliable
advertising.</p>

<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c008'>If you know of anybody looking for a

<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c008'>Speaking of advertising, we have a letter
from one of our patrons who have
been advertising with us from the start,
who say they are advertising in several
other publications, and that they are getting
more replies and more business from
TROTWOOD’S than from any of the
others. We are going to publish their
letter in the next issue, so look out for it.</p>

<hr class='c016' />

<p class='c008'>Dr. E. Marshall Harrell, of Media, Pa.,
offers some good horses for sale, as he
thinks he would like an automobile better
than the horses. The doctor probably
knows best, and no doubt has
marked the price low to make a quick
deal.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. W. R. Spooner, of Republic, Ohio,

</div>

<p class='c008'>In action upon the History Report at the Louisville
Reunion, June, 1905, the United Confederate
Veterans adopted with enthusiasm the following:</p>

<p class='c012'>It is appropriate to mention the official organ of this body,
the <span class='sc'>Confederate Veteran</span>, founded, edited, and conducted exclusively
for the benefit of the Confederate soldiers’ name, fame,
and cause, by our comrade, S. A. Cunningham. For many years
it has been the official organ of our own great Association as well
as of the United Sons of Confederate Veterans, the United
Daughters of the Confederacy, and the Confederated Southern
Memorial Association, publishing the proceedings of their sessions,
their work, and their achievements. Thus it has been the
medium through which all that concerns the work of Confederate
Associations can be so published that their coöperation may be
made effective. As a magazine devoted to the objects of these
Associations it is a secure repository of war incidents, biography,
reminiscence, history, and documents, and is already a full treasury
of Confederate data. It is very gratifying that this ally of
ours has attained a high position among our country’s magazines.
Its issue of 22,000 copies this month proves its popularity
and certifies its stability. <i>But your committee believes that in
consideration of its worth and of the broad area of its circulation,
South and North, it deserves the united support of this
body, and it would become of greater service to us if all Camps
and Chapters would adopt measures to double its subscriptions.</i></p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
